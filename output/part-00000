@@31637541 <h> Why NZ is more exposed to the economic effect of Coronavirus <h> Why New Zealand is more exposed than others to the economic chills of China 's coronavirus outbreak <p> The economic repercussions of the coronavirus outbreak worldwide and for New Zealand are beginning to emerge -- and it is already clear that the coronavirus will have a worse impact than the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in 2003 . <p> This four-fold increase in economic dependence on China worldwide , primarily because of its status as a manufacturing hub and a key node for production networks in Asia and globally , means that the outbreak is likely to have a bigger global impact on trade , at least in the current quarter . <p> But over the same period since 2003 , New Zealand has become even more economically dependent on China . This is particularly so in trade in commercial services ( both exports and imports ) , with a 12-fold jump in China 's share , based on comparisons between historical and the latest Stats NZ data . <h> Slumping exports and cancelled events <p> In 2003 , New Zealand 's goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on historical data from the United Nations . Today , it is about 26% . Any slump in export demand from China in the current quarter will have a much stronger direct impact on New Zealand exporters ' earnings , for both trade in goods and commercial services , than for many other countries . <p> This is already evident . Food exporters are facing declining demand for meat products , forestry , flower and seafood products from consumers in China . The outbreak could also disrupt supply chains of intermediate products New Zealand imports from China and the rest of Asia for agricultural and food production . <p> As of 2019 , China was New Zealand 's fourth largest service export destination , constituting 13% of the country 's total exports of commercial services , which includes primarily education and tourism .

It is estimated that this itself would result in at least a 0.4% decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2020 . <p> The above is a conservative estimate . It assumes that the coronavirus outbreak is contained quickly and will not affect the second quarter of the year . The SARS outbreak took about eight months to contain , so it is reasonable to assume that travel and education exports from New Zealand may veer off their normal trajectory at least until mid-2020 . <p> While the indirect impact of the coronavirus on New Zealand consumers remains unclear , the direction is likely to be negative .

Australia , the US and Japan all fit into this category . <p> In the short term , New Zealand may receive fewer tourists from these countries , including both air and sea travel .

Despite a ' comeback of the century ' recovery on Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares since the depths of the global financial crisis of over a decade ago . <p> Of course , the fuel for the selling bonfire continues to be provided by the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> This week was marked by prime-time TV addresses from both our Prime Minister Scott Morrison , and President Donald Trump over in the USA . Further travel restrictions as well as a ban on public gatherings of more than 500 people have been announced , and it seems more measures will be put in place to contain this virus in due course . <p> The record highs we were seeing just one month ago seem a distant memory already . <p> The ASX 200 has now fallen 22.96% from the peak reached in mid-February . We are still firmly in bear market territory , and the ' 2020 crash ' is solidifying as a defining moment in the history of the ASX . <p> Let 's recap ! <h> How did the markets end the week ? <p> On Monday , the ASX 200 was sitting at 6,216 points . <p> On the closing bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points -- a drop of 10.89% for the week . <p> Yet this number only tells half of the story . <p> Monday saw a drop of 7.33% . Tuesday -- a rise of 3.11% . Wednesday then saw a reversal with another drop of 3.6% . On Thursday , we had a nasty fall of 7.36% . <p> Then came Friday . <p> Soon after Friday 's open , we seemed to be staring down the barrel of oblivion with what was looking to be a fall of over 8% for the ASX 200 to 4,874 points . <p> ASX shares had seemingly gone into freefall and panic was everywhere . Some brokering websites were even crashing under the strain . <p> That 's right , the ASX actually had a 12% turnaround mid-session . It was truly something incredible to behold ( told here from firsthand experience ! ) . <p> Just take a look at the graph of Friday 's ASX 200 moves below for some proof . It almost resembles a skate-park installation ! <p> Source : fool.com.au <p> It was n't enough to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the bleeding was staunched . Meanwhile , the ALL ORDINARIES ( ASX : XAO ) was down 11.07% for the week . The Aussie dollar has also continued to slide and is now perilously close to falling below 60 US cents -- sitting at 61.82 cents as we start the week . <h> Which ASX shares were the biggest winners and losers ? <p> Let 's take a look at the biggest winners and losers on Friday . Here are the losers : <p> Chart : Author 's Own <p> As you can see , gold stocks like Gold Road Resources Ltd ( ASX : GOR ) were amongst the losers last week as the gold price failed to compensate for the falling stock market . Other losers all have close ties to the coronavirus . The Qantas Airways Limited ( ASX : QAN ) share price is starting to approach the $3 mark as travel bans extend and the Prime Minister tells Australians not to travel unless absolutely necessary . <p> **29;1492;TOOLONG : URW ) is also in the firing line as there 's no doubt its European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by travel restrictions and bans on public gatherings . <p> And with the bad news out of the way , here are Friday 's winners : <p> Chart : Author 's Own <p> Healthcare giant Cochlear Limited ( ASX : COH ) tops the list with a heart-fluttering 21.08% gain without too much cause . It seems investors are n't too concerned about healthcare companies at the present time . <p> Oil stocks like Oil Search Ltd ( ASX : OSH ) and Viva Energy Group Ltd ( ASX : VEA ) also experienced some healthy rebounds after last week 's rout . Oil prices have yet to recover after the oil price plunge last week , but clearly investors have decided that the fire sale of oil shares last week was overdone . <h> What is this week looking like for the ASX ? <p> Well , after last week , it 's safe to say that anything could happen this week . I myself am expecting more extreme volatility and I think it would be wise to adopt similar expectations . <p> There are signs that both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve are planning more monetary easing ( which has the potential to move markets ) , but we will have to wait and see if and how this materialises . <p> A lot of the volatility we saw on global markets last week was prompted by the responses ( or lack thereof ) from the White House over in the US , so that will be something to keep an eye on . <p> I think it 's also worth noting that a typical bear market ( as we are now in ) historically lasts for at least 6 months if not longer , so that 's something to keep in mind as we start the new week . We are nowhere near being close to out of the woods yet in terms of the coronavirus situation , so I think it would be wise for all investors to be prepared anything . <p> So with that said , here 's how the top ASX blue chips are looking as we start this week : <p> Chart : Author 's Own <p> And finally , here is the lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S&amp;P/ASX 200 ( XJO ) at 5,539.3 points <p> ALL ORDINARIES ( XAO ) at 5,590.7 points <p> Gold is asking US$1,529 per troy ounce <p> Brent crude oil is trading at US$33.85 a barrel <p> Australian Dollar buying 61.82 US cents <h> Foolish takeaway <p> Before we go , I would like to take this time to wish all of our readers the very best during this tough time .

@@71710241 <p> The bond market moves of last year caught most investors off guard , as many were expecting higher cash rates over the year . Currently , market expectations see the opposite outcome compared to 2019 , with forecasts expecting lower cash rates from the RBA and an eventual start of a quantitative easing ( QE ) program . <p> While we have some sympathy for why this could be required , we think the case for that occurring in 2020 is nowhere near as clear cut as the market is currently forecasting . In fact , some lead indicators ( such as housing and inflation ) are beginning to point to 2020 being stronger than 2019 , which would allow the RBA to hold some of their monetary policy ammunition in reserve . <p> Rather than focusing on the current narrative of a slow economy , we pose in our latest paper five big picture questions the RBA should be answering to land at our interest rate outlook and what it means for domestic bond yields in 2020 . A summary of our views is below and the full PDF can be accessed here . <h> Q1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for house prices ? <p> The improved housing outlook for 2020 , compared to the beginning of 2019 , has the potential to create the " gentle turning " point the RBA has spoken of . While the recent housing related data has been sluggish , our indicators show that the economic data can take a few quarters to react . Hence , while the market has been impatient by wanting faster results , we think this may have been asking too much too soon . <p> To demonstrate this point , we show three key indicators that should show signs of improvement this year and that we believe will be important to watch in early 2020 : <p> Household demand -- The chart below shows that over the past 10 years household demand in these states has lagged house prices by approximately nine months , meaning house price conditions today will affect demand in 2 -- 4 quarter 's time . It also means that it can take some time for the RBA 's actions to flow through to the real economy . <p> Chart 1 - NSW and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Housing inflation - Over the past 10 years , housing inflation has been on a slow trend downwards , falling from 6% p.a. growth to 20-year-lows of 1% p.a . Despite this downward trend , every time the RBA has cut interest rates housing inflation has risen by 0.5% to 3% over the subsequent 12 months . Given that the response in house prices so far has been similar to previous cuts , we think there is a good argument to be made that housing inflation will also follow the same pattern -- providing an improved backdrop from last year . <p> Building approvals - The third improvement that we would expect to see is in the construction outlook for late 2020 -- as building approvals typically follow house prices with a lag . The following chart shows that building approvals usually decline with house prices and a more positive outlook should give this some support . <p> Chart 2 - House prices and building approvals <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> Prices are set to rise <p> While not related to economic data , the final point to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into more aggressive housing headlines as prices reach all-time highs . The next chart shows that the current house price index is only 4% of its 2018 peak . Since prices have been increasing at over 1% per month , we should see prices set new highs in only a few months . <p> Chart 3 - Australian house price index <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> While none of these indicators say that the improvement in housing-related sectors are a certainty , they do suggest a far stronger outlook than what we saw at the beginning of 2019 . <h> Q2 : How strong will inflation and unemployment be in 2020 ? <p> The first signs of this improvement can be seen in inflation , as currently the indicators we pay attention to point towards a grind back into the low 2% territory in the first half of 2020 . This is based off three key pieces of information , which were not in place this time last year . <p> Firstly , as noted above , housing inflation should bottom out as the housing market is showing strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it higher housing inflation . <p> Secondly , Australian petrol prices had started rising and this has a very strong correlation with transportation inflation . If petrol prices remain at their current levels , this would imply transportation prices see mildly positive rises into the first quarter of this year -- a small pickup compared to the 0% observed through 2019 . <p> Prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus , oil prices had actually been showing large increases year-on-year , meaning if the market recovers from this shock we could be looking at higher transport-related inflation for the year . <p> The third reason to expect higher inflation figures is simply from the distribution of inflation outcomes . The table below shows the quarterly and yearly inflation figures over the past 24 months . The main reason that headline inflation dipped so low in 2019 was that the first quarter had an inflation print of 0% quarter-on-quarter , taking the consistent 1.8 -- 2.0% inflation level into the low 1% range . Outside of this first quarter , the inflation figures had consistently remained in the 0.4% -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation figures - 24 months <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> Given we see more inflationary signs in the beginning of 2020 than we did in 2019 , we suspect that in 1Q 2020 this zero outcome will be replaced with a higher quarterly figure , pulling inflation back towards 2% instead of 1% . <p> Unemployment outlook <p> While the unemployment rate shifted slightly higher during the year , ending 2019 at 5.1% , this was only marginally higher than the 5.0% seen at the end of 2018 . Additionally , the outright levels of employment are only marginally below the high point seen in 2007 , as the employment to population ratio ( an employment indicator which calculates what percentage of the population is working ) saw an almost record high of 62.6% of the total population working . <p> Chart 4 -- Australia : employment to population <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> It 's important to separate the narrative around employment from the facts . Yes , some forward looking indicators have started to slow ( such as job advertisements and vacancies ) , but the NAB employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economy . We find the NAB business conditions is one of the better indicators at forecasting the unemployment rate in the near term , and this is suggesting that the unemployment rate should move sideways , i.e. 5.0 -- 5.2% , over the coming months . <p> Chart 5 - NAB employment conditions and unemployment rate change <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> This would suggest that not only was the narrative around employment misguided in 2019 , but the near-term forecast should not be as bearish as the market currently insists . <h> Q3 : Is global trade set to improve ? <p> 2019 proved to be a relatively weak year for global trade and , unsurprisingly , the Chinese trade statistics reflected this reality . However , there are some tentative signs that this could be slightly more positive for 2020 . <p> Chinese trade statistics <p> The first positive sign for global trade is that Chinese trade statistics have shown signs of life after being consistently weak for the past 12 months . Importantly for global trade , Chinese imports lead the global cycle by approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a relatively large rise . This means that as long as the coronavirus does not considerably alter the momentum of the global economy , then come mid-2020 we should see signs that global trade is beginning to improve and potentially pick up dramatically in the back end of 2020 . <p> World trade and Chinese imports <p> Source : Bloomberg , World Trade Organisation <p> Reflecting this positive import outcome , the Chinese PMI figures saw new export orders rise above 50 the first time since the middle of 2018 . This is off the back of positive outcomes between China and the US on trade talks , potentially signaling that companies are becoming more positive on the future trade environment . <p> Additionally , South Korean and Taiwanese exports -- two economies which are traditionally thought of as the canary in the coal mine of global trade -- started improving . Both countries had negative outcomes through 2019 , which have started turning and could signal that the pickup is more widespread than simply China . <p> If this is true , the Australian economy should benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move rates . <p> The caveat to this improvement is that these statistics have been occurring through the December and January data . Whether this improvement can continue in the face of the coronovirus is yet to be a seen and poses a large risk to global trade . This is addressed in a separate question below . <h> Q4 : Where is the Tail Risk -- The known unknowns ? <p> While we do n't cover the US -- China trade war ( as enough ink has already been spilled on this topic ) or the deterioration in relationship between Iran and the US in this outlook , it is worthwhile pointing out the risk that could come from the coronavirus , which appears to have originated in China . <p> At the time of writing , the facts surrounding this disease are murky as the number of cases and deaths rise by the day . However , from the information available the market is so far looking at it in a similar nature as the SARS outbreak of 2003 , although it seems to be less deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is hard to determine just how many people will contract the disease and how long the epidemic will last , so we 're unable to forecast just how large the effect will be on international conditions . More specifically though , the fact that the Chinese government has quarantined multiple cities , with a combined population in the tens of millions of people , it means there will likely be a hit to Chinese GDP as , among the numerous other effects , consumption will be lower and tourism down . Additionally , the timing of the event over Chinese New Year means the effects will be larger than if this had of occurred at a different time of the year . <p> From this perspective , the total effect is currently unknown , but we do know that it will not be positive . The offset to this is that the Chinese government could ( and likely will ) introduce easier fiscal policy to offset the weaker conditions that their containment policies have created . Depending on the actions that they take , this could potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , which is followed by an acceleration in the second half . <p> Chinese demand and tourism <p> Whether these risks are enough to cause the RBA to cut or not are a key question that they will need to answer this year . Slower Chinese demand and weaker travel from Chinese tourists , which represent the greatest number of outbound tourists in the world , would be a key risk for the Australian economy , coming at a time when GDP is weak . While we think that the RBA should not overact to this information , and wait to see how global trade evolves over the next three months , it does create a story that naturally feeds into easier rates and will cause the RBA to become more dovish if it persists for some time . <h> Q5 : How will the RBA respond to the widespread bushfires ? <p> While the total financial cost from the fires is unknown at the time of writing , most estimates have put the effect on GDP in the short term at a drag of around 0.2% -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a recession , it has come at a time when GDP is at its weakest in 10 years . If the RBA was negative enough on the conditions , it could be seen as just one more reason to move rates . However , while there is a short-term impact , If past natural disasters are anything to go by we should see this be a positive for GDP in the next few quarters as higher investment will occur across the regions that have been hit by the bushfires ( refer to Chart 19 ) . <p> On top of this we see a fiscal response to the affected regions as the more appropriate policy measure as it means the help required will land where it is needed most , rather than lower rates benefitting the country at large . <p> As such , we think that the RBA should not react to the fires , as the medium term effects will be limited and it is more appropriate for a fiscal ( rather than monetary ) policy response . <p> The other consideration here is whether the RBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about the future for potential policy action .

@@83746941 <h> RSA Conference 2020 : What I 'll Be Looking For At This Year 's Show <p> This year marks my first trip to RSA Conference in San Francisco . I wanted to take a step back and reflect on what I want to gain from the conference . Like many analysts attending , my diary looks like the baubles on a Christmas tree , hung resplendently with meetings , briefings , and everything in between . <p> Here are a few things I 'll be looking for as I go to the event this year : <p> What 's new that 's going to disrupt the industry ? One of the things I enjoy most about going to these conferences is the ability to spend time with early-stage companies . Some of the freshest and most disruptive ideas I 've seen in the two years that I 've been an analyst have come from companies at this stage of their development . I plan to try to catch the Innovation Zone at RSA and Sandbox to check out some of the latest startups in the US and beyond . One interesting thing for this year 's Innovation Sandbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most companies this year are at . Many of them have raised Series A funding already and are on the way to being quite established -- that 's a very different profile compared to 2019 . <p> What is the theme of 2020 going to be ? I am going to be keen to see if there 's any key theme to what I see and hear at the stands , briefings , and talks . In 2019 , Zero Trust was the big theme ; one of my colleagues was reportedly nearly run over by a bus emblazoned with Zero Trust . In 2020 , I 'm going to hazard an educated guess that I 'm going to hear a lot about SPOGs ( single panes of glass ) , SOAR ( security orchestration and automation ) , and AI . This reflects my bias of coverage toward service providers , but I also think that human security ( e.g. , the future of the CISO role , human behavior and cultural change , and mental health in the security industry ) and Zero Trust implementation will feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now is probably not the best time to tell me about that new widget .

With that volume of meetings and jet lag ( I 'm based in the UK ) , I 'm probably not going to retain all that information . Save detailed briefings for the regular briefings process , and spend the time getting to know my coverage and striking up a conversation about where we have mutual interests and can continue to work together after the show . I do n't travel to the US that frequently , so let 's use this face-to-face time in a mutually beneficial manner . <p> Be prepared to talk at a regional level . As a UK-based analyst with a significant portion of my coverage dedicated to the European region , I am particularly interested in hearing how customers in my region experience and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ohio or hospital in Denver is n't going to be that interesting to me , so save those for others . <p> I look forward to meeting with various contacts , new and old , and to a first RSA Conference in two weeks ' time . <h> Predictions 2020 <h> Discover the dynamics that will define 2020 and beyond . <p> As 40,000 attendees descend on San Francisco for the annual security pilgrimage that is the RSA Conference , more sponsors pull out of the event citing safety concerns over the Coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) Pandemic . <p> The human capital management ( HCM ) technology market is a hotbed of M&amp;A activity , so to anyone who follows it , this merger should n't be a huge surprise .

@@31755441 <p> By now , you may have noticed a divide among your friends . As social distancing and self-imposed quarantine wear on and more workplaces urge employees to avoid the office , the Covid-19 outbreak has left many people more alone than they 've been in a long time , or ever . Some are responding by hunkering down into cozy domesticity : baking bread , reading books , taking long baths . Others have begun to fray : FaceTiming with friends is a necessity , not a luxury ; the closure of a favorite coffee shop is cause for tears ; the walls seem to be closing in . Be kind to your local extroverts . They 're having a hard time . <p> Still , no matter how hygge you 're feeling at this moment , experts suggest that the negative feelings and experiences associated with prolonged isolation will come for us all . Humans are social creatures -- yes , all of us . While the coronavirus pandemic is an extreme , largely unprecedented moment , the kind of seclusion that 's been eating at people over the last few weeks is not as uncommon an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation on our bodies and minds have been felt and studied in a variety of different groups , from astronauts to incarcerated people to immunocompromised children to Antarctic researchers to the elderly . The patterns that have emerged from their experiences with radical aloneness illuminate ways to understand and improve your own . <p> First off , it 's important to remember that isolation does n't just numb your brain with boredom . " People start getting lethargic when they do n't have positive inputs into their small worlds , " says John Vincent , a clinical psychologist at the University of Houston . " We can expect depression to kick in , and depression and anxiety are kissing cousins . " These symptoms are likely to be particularly intense during coronavirus-related isolation , according to Lawrence Palinkas , who researches psychosocial adaptation to extreme environments at the University of Southern California . " Oftentimes , if you have a very well defined period of time in which you 're isolated people do pretty well up until the halfway point , " Palinkas says . " Then they experience a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we are now , when you 're not certain how long you 'll be asked to maintain social distance , that produces anxiety as well . " <p> When people , like those kept in solitary confinement or scientists working in a remote region , know their sentence is nearly up , their mood lifts again in anticipation . Those practicing social distancing due to Covid-19 may not get that any time soon . " Open , transparent , consistent communication is the most important thing governments and organizations can do : Make sure people understand why they are being quarantined first and foremost , how long it is expected to last , " says Samantha Brooks , who has studied the psychological impact of quarantine at King 's College London . " A huge factor in the negative psychological impact seems to be confusion about what 's going on , not having clear guidelines , or getting different messages from different organizations . " So far , many governments , including the United States ' , have n't been heeding this advice . <p> Perhaps even more concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Harry Taylor , who studies social isolation in older adults , particularly in the black community , says that it 's one of the worst things that humans can do to their overall well-being , adding that " the mortality effect of social isolation is like smoking 15 cigarettes per day . " In older people , social isolation seems to exacerbate any preexisting medical conditions , from cardiovascular diseases to Alzheimer 's , but its ill effects are n't limited to those over 60 . <p> Alexander Chouker , a physician researcher who studies stress immunology at the University of Munich , has seen radical changes in the bodies of people participating in simulations of manned spaceflight missions like Mars-500 . " They were young and trained people not in a condition of real threat , " he says . " The pure fact of being confined affects the body . If you change your environment in a quite extreme way , it is changing you . " Participants , some of whom were only isolated for three months , experienced changes to their sleep , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alterations to their metabolisms . " Being confined and isolated affects the human physiology as a whole , " Chouker says . <p> Does this mean your body will go wonky like an astronaut trapped on fake Mars for over a year ? Not necessarily . You probably are n't truly socially isolated , at least not to that extreme degree . And even those who study the negative consequences of social isolation still think practicing social distancing is a good idea . " Covid-19 is flipping everything on its head , " Taylor says . " This is the first time since we have been alive that actively practicing social isolation is a method to improve health . " <p> The people who are most at risk from the isolation associated with Covid-19 are the people who are at heightened risk of social isolation in the first place . " Among older adults , lower income people and men experience isolation at a different level , " says Thomas Cudjoe , a geriatrician researching the intersection of social connections and aging at Johns Hopkins University . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inclination to develop social ties outside of work creates the disparity between those groups and their female or higher income counterparts . ) Taylor points out that anyone who is marginalized is more likely to have a more limited social network , whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community , a survivor of domestic abuse , or just live in a more isolated rural area . <p> These people may not have friends or family to call , or may be unable to do so . " Some people have posited technology as a means of connecting people , but lower income groups might not even have FaceTime or Skype or minutes on their phone , " Cudjoe says . " People take that for granted , using their devices can be a strain on people 's incomes . " Particularly if Covid-19 has left them out of a job . " Minority bodies are going to be hit particularly hard because they often work in service industries , which increases risk for social isolation and loneliness and coronavirus , " says Taylor . " It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter what your unique situation is , there are many things you can do to improve your experience while being socially isolated . Chouker and others recommend exercise as a mood boost . " Create as much structure and predictability as you can with the pieces of your life that you do have control over , " Vincent says . Pursue neglected projects , get on with life , but also be patient with yourself -- both now and when this strange time eventually ends . People who go through a period of isolation , whether they 've been on the International Space Station or in quarantine , often experience PTSD symptoms and struggle while reintegrating back into their ordinary routine . Social isolation may gradually become your normal , and losing it may still be a jolt . <p> Fortunately , you 're not in this alone , and you should n't leave others that way , either . " For the general public who are not isolated , think about those people who were in your network that you have n't heard from in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cudjoe says .

@@84582141 <p> The numbers associated with COVID-19 , its infectivity , hospital admissions , deaths , are all being studied like tea leaves for any pattern or trend . And the numbers vary quite a bit . Those variations are often ascribed to the veracity of the source or some underlying agenda of hope or fearmongering , and occasionally to a mathematical error . <p> But in most instances , the problem is really two old cognitive difficulties , numbers appear far more precise and concrete than they actually are and a number by itself has little meaning , it requires the context , often another number -- ratios . <p> Rate of Infection <p> R0 is a means of quantifying how infectious the virus is , and you have all seen the numbers suggesting that it is worse than seasonal flu and not as bad as measles . Knowing the rate of infection is a way to get a handle on how quickly COVID-19 has spread , and that often is described as the rate of infection for a given population . The explicit ratio is the number of infected individuals divided by the size of the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , essential set of numbers -- how many people are being tested and the incidence of positive findings . <p> A study of the available data from New York City 1 broken out by zip code is instructive . Recently , the press has made quite a point of discussing the socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 's victims , largely the same groups that suffer from inadequate access to medical care , lower incomes , and additional co-morbidities . And looking at the map of the five boroughs confirms those findings . Those purple areas include the Bronx , parts of Queens , Brooklyn , and Staten Island . But are those numbers accurate ? <p> The researcher made use of COVID-19 testing information , available by zip code , and integrated it with census data , describing the general characteristics of the zip code , income , housing , minority representation . That data does n't tell a different story , but it shows that the number of infected individuals may be significantly underestimated . <p> Graph A shows that the number of tests performed does not vary with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and state government is testing without racial bias . <p> Graph B shows that predilection of COVID-19 for minority communities , the greater the percentage , the higher the rate of positive tests . <p> Those two trends come together in Graph C , the incidence or number of infected individuals . You can see that the equality of testing has inadvertently lowered the impact of those positive tests . What is politically correct is not appropriate for public health measurements . More testing needs to be done in the hotspot zip codes , and less in the parts of New York where we can see the incidence is less . <p> Before some jump to attribute this to politics , remember that this is , in part , a chicken and egg problem , you ca n't focus testing until you have a better idea where to focus . But intent aside , you can begin to see why infectivity rates can vary so much . The amount of testing , the true incidence in the population , and the population 's size are aggregated within that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , like population density , age , and co-morbidities . For as much as the number seems concrete , it is built upon many forces pulling in different directions . <p> COVID-19 Deaths <p> Well , we can understand how infectivity may be challenging to quantify , but surely death is easier -- you are either alive or dead , a binary option . The difficulty in quantifying death begins the moment after all vital signs go to zero . Because death can be the result of a criminal act , it comes with regulations , the most important being that a physician must both certify and identify the reasons for death . <p> " A cause of death is the morbid condition or disease process , abnormality , injury , or poisoning leading directly or indirectly to death . The underlying cause of death is the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly or indirectly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury . A death often results from the combined effect of two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independently of each other or they may be causally related to each other , that is , one cause may lead to another which in turn leads to a third cause , etc . <p> ... He is requested to report in Part I on line ( a ) the immediate cause of death and the antecedent conditions on lines ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) which gave rise to the cause reported on line ( a ) , the underlying cause being stated lowest in the sequence of events . However , no entry is necessary on I(b) , I(c) or I(d) if the immediate cause of death stated on I(a) describes completely the sequence of events . " <p> In the case of COVID-19 , a certificate might state that the immediate cause was viral pneumonia due to Coronavirus , along with antecedent conditions , co-morbidities , like hypertension and coronary artery disease . There is a 216-page manual 2 , that determines which among those immediate and antecedent causes is finally reported as the " cause of death . " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals , the duty to certify often falls to the first-year resident , who knows the least about any given patient . In community hospitals , it falls to the attending physician , and for deaths at home , to the patient 's primary care physician ; but while they know the patient 's history better , it would be a rare case when they were specifically trained in completing a death certificate . And I seriously doubt that any physician , other than a pathologist who studies dead patients , has even a nodding acquaintance with that 216-page manual . <p> To further simplify the attribution of death in the time of pandemic , Italy 's overwhelmed health system decided that any deaths in the hospital were attributed to COVID-19 . That , of course , increases the false-positive reports , increasing the deaths . It is balanced to some unknown degree by the physicians certifying deaths at home as not being due to COVID-19 , the false negatives . This week , as reported by the New York Post , our federal government has opted for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in Italy , it will mean higher death rates . <p> If you look at the current CDC data , you will find that a COVID-19 death does not require laboratory evidence , it is sufficient that " the certifier suspects COVID-19 or determines it was likely . " Another important limitation noted is this provisional information is incomplete , and " the level of completeness varies by jurisdiction , week , decedent 's age , and cause of death . ... It is important to note that the true levels of completeness are unknown , and the estimates provided here are only a proxy . " It has taken , in the past , up to 2 months to gather and verify 72% of pneumonia deaths . <p> Again , before jumping to identify a political intent to these changes , it is perhaps best to recognize how overwhelmed is the health system 's information technology . It was probably better prepared to deal with a computer virus than an actual one . But what is one bureaucrat 's efficiency in making all deaths due to COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tease out how the virus behaves .

However , the health department and other experts have been quick to rubbish this as hogwash . <p> Dr Satyanarayana Mysore ( HoD , interventional pulmonology at Manipal Hospitals ) said , " In the case of a 10-month-old baby who has tested positive , the parents should not have taken the child to Kerala .

The majority of those infected are in Wuhan , and the Chinese government is putting its resources into building new medical facilities , fast . Millions are watching daily videos of an architectural feat : two fully functioning hospitals rising from the ground in mere days . <p> Broadcast by Chinese state media , drone footage of the construction site shows a ballet of bulldozers digging the foundation and a parade of trucks hauling in steel cable , cement , pre-fab parts and power generators . Workers are toiling around the clock to meet the frantic timeline : Huoshenshan Hospital , which broke ground on Jan. 24 , is scheduled to be operational on Feb. 3 , will have 1,000 beds and occupy a 269,000 sq . ft. lot in the edge of the city . With an equally ambitious timeline is Leishenshan Hospital , a 323,000-sq. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wuhan 's breakneck construction pace brings up several questions : How can the Chinese radically compress construction timelines ?

" <p> " I would hesitate to refer to the hospital being erected today in Wuhan as a permanent hospital , and it is certainly not a full-service facility , " he tells Quartz . " When we are designing the latter , we consider the building 's use and adaptability for 75 years into the future ... China does not have that luxury in designing its new hospital in Wuhan . " <p> Rawlings , who is currently working on a new , 500-bed hospital in Chengdu and two hospitals in Hong Kong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spent in consulting with patients , medical staff , healthcare administrators , and the surrounding community to make sure a design works for all constituents . <p> With no time for consultations for a custom design , Wuhan officials are using blueprints from the Xiaotangshan Hospital , a 1,000-bed facility in the outskirts of Beijing assembled in a week during the SARS epidemic in 2003 . <h> Pre-fab hospitals : Safe but not always sustainable <p> Using prefabricated units is the key to expediting Wuhan 's hospitals . Fully-assembled , factory-made rooms are trucked on site and dropped into place . <p> This building technique is completely safe , assures Thorsten Helbig , a structural engineer and co-founder of the German engineering firm Knippers Helbig who currently teaches at the Cooper Union in New York City . " You can definitely make pre-fab buildings structurally sound , " he says . <p> He explains that because units are assembled under the controlled environment of a factory , designers and builders can troubleshoot any problems and make sure all the modular blocks work together before they 're even brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliant on weather conditions and the choreography of various contractors who work on different aspects of a project .

The US Department of Defense , for example , can quickly erect field hospitals for emergency diagnosis and treatment , almost anywhere . Students at Clemson University 's Architecture + Health Program are testing the viability of using shipping containers , chained together , to assemble a rapid-response medical facility , he explains . " The technology exists and is being used , " Rawlings says . " Its advancement is probably the future of rapidly deployable healthcare .

" In many ways China is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to responding to mass infections , as they 've been through this before with SARS in the early 2000s , " he says . " China can also have fewer bureaucratic restrictions when it comes to designing and constructing massive projects like this one , particularly when so much is on the line . " <p> There are noteworthy factors that accelerate building projects in China : the lack of labor unions , the steady influx of cheap labor from provincial towns , and the availability of building materials . But this does n't necessarily mean that China 's building standards are more lax compared to Western counterparts . <p> Helbig , who has worked on several major infrastructure projects in China including Shenzhen Bao'an airport and a Disney resort in Shanghai , says that he found that safety is a priority in China .

Compared to the US and European countries , Chinese are more comfortable with embracing new building methods , Helbig observes . " They are very open to new technologies and technological changes , and this is really different from the Western world in some ways , " he says . " As an engineer , I appreciate this attitude . The Chinese will rarely cling to how they 've done things in the past . " <p> But as fast and safe buildings rise in China , they 're not necessarily always sustainable .

@@83602441 <p> Initially , the U.S. government adopted a relatively measured response , even as political commentators and some members of Congress demanded that the United States ban all travel from China . It resisted travel bans in lieu of warning people to avoid nonessential travel to China and screening passengers from China at 20 international airports . Its decision Friday to deny entry to non-nationals who have recently traveled to China and quarantine Americans who are returning from that country marks a significant , and potentially counterproductive , escalation in the U.S. response to the coronavirus crisis . <p> Although this may assuage critics who insisted that the administration take more aggressive action , history and epidemiology warn us that such measures are unlikely to work .

After a federal court , in a rare example of judicial intervention during a public health panic , struck down that measure , the city established a quarantine around a neighborhood where many Chinese residents lived , enforcing it only against Chinese residents . That quarantine was also found to be unconstitutionally discriminatory . Decades later , HIV similarly provoked discrimination against groups perceived to be at the highest risk . As children such as Ryan White were kept out of school and well-known commentators demanded widespread quarantine , the Coast Guard picked up asylum-seeking Haitians and quarantined them at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Given that HIV was already widespread , as Judy Rabinovitz , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , noted at the time , " there can be no pretense that this can be to the public health benefit of the United States .

Despite assurances by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that blood and other bodily fluids were the primary modes of transmission , the news media fueled public fear about casual transmission . Governors responded by quarantining travelers who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola . Although she was not infected , Kaci Hickox , a nurse , was involuntarily detained in a tent outside Newark International Airport after arriving from West Africa , where she had treated patients . After Hickox told her story to the media , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie ( R ) allowed her to travel to Maine , where state officials sought to quarantine her . A federal court later dismissed her constitutional challenge to New Jersey 's actions , and a federal court in Connecticut likewise dismissed a case brought by several people quarantined in that state . ( An appeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Ebola scare had lasting implications for how the federal government might respond to future outbreaks . In 2017 , the CDC published new federal quarantine regulations . Federal law had long given CDC broad powers to restrict international and interstate travel and apprehend and detain people who are thought to have a quarantinable disease ( a designation established by presidential order ) . Despite the breadth of that authority , the CDC had generally left infection control , at least within the country , to state and local health departments . Indeed , the CDC 's own prior quarantine regulations were remarkably thin , offering little guidance as to when and how the agency should exercise its authority . The updated regulations provide far greater specificity , authorizing the CDC to collect detailed information about travelers ' health status , and detain or bar travel ( including interstate travel ) of people who have -- or are " reasonably believed " to be infected with -- a quarantinable disease .

Critics , including one of us , worried that the due-process review provisions were inadequate , allowing people to be detained for relatively long periods while the review proceeded . In addition , the regulations do not provide for review by an independent decision-maker . They also do not limit detentions and travel bans to situations in which they are the least restrictive alternative , a standard that some courts have held to be constitutionally compelled . Also absent are protections from deportation and income replacement for people who are quarantined . Both protections may be critical to ensuring that people are willing to comply rather than seek to evade quarantine orders . In addition to these lapses , the regulations have few safeguards to prevent federal officials from wielding their public health powers in ineffective , potentially abusive ways . And as the Ebola lawsuits show , the public can not count on the courts to protect them from public health overreaches .

The other is trust : In times of peril , it 's critical that the public have faith in the expertise and good intentions of health officials .

' s March Housing Trends Report released today . The monthly report provides the first data-based glimpse into the impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on residential real estate as the market enters the spring home-buying season . <p> Due to the strong start to the month , the total number of homes for sale in March overall declined 15.7 percent from the same time a year ago , a faster rate of decline compared to the 15.3 percent drop in February . This amounts to 191,000 fewer homes for sale year-over-year . The impact of COVID-19 materialized in the latter half of March .

@@71760441 <p> Amid the spectacularly divisive response to Kristen Roupenian 's short story about a relationship gone wrong , the author 's conception of " Cat Person " as horror fiction was often overlooked . Here , she talks about reasserting her genre credentials with the release of her debut collection . " The temptation would be to turn the book into 11 stories about dating from the perspective of young women . So I was grateful that editors recognised it was a weird , dark collection of essentially horror stories . They let it be what it was . " By Katherine Gillespie . <p> Kristen Roupenian on short stories and viral success <p> Author Kristen Roupenian . <p> Credit : Urszula Soltys <p> When Kristen Roupenian had her short story " Cat Person " accepted for publication in The New Yorker at the end of 2017 , the then 36-year-old quietly celebrated a career milestone that had eluded many of her more established peers . She looked forward to gaining some new readers and harboured hopes of attracting a book deal . <p> What she got instead was viral fame unprecedented for fiction authors , with an initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat Person " , written from the naive perspective of an undergraduate student dating an older man she meets at work , appeared just as conversations about sex and power were reaching fever pitch in the wake of assault allegations arising against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein . Just as the #MeToo movement was taking hold , Roupenian 's story of an unbalanced romance that ends on a note of sharp and unexpected cruelty gained tweetable relevance beyond any hopes she might have had as a fresh fine arts graduate in writing from the University of Michigan . <p> It also got her that book deal , complete with a staggering advance of $US1.2 million . Her debut collection You Know You Want This was published this month , with " Cat Person " one of its 12 unnerving stories about doomed love , mental health spirals and serial killers . Fortunately , while the viral success of her New Yorker debut was a surprise , when the opportunity of a book inevitably followed , she was ready . Most of the collection 's stories had been written while Roupenian was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says from a London hotel room at the beginning of a long promotional tour that will take her across the world . " I ca n't even imagine what my life would have been like if ' Cat Person ' had been the first story I 'd ever written and I was suddenly on the stage trying to write the rest under pressure of expectation to re-create it . " <p> Roupenian says the whirlwind of attention she received has left her in " deep shock and confusion " . She had no inkling that " Cat Person " would prove in any way controversial or provocative , although " it felt new in the history of the kinds of stories I 'd been writing , and I was proud of it " . She says New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman remains baffled by the extreme reaction , too . <p> The story has young college student , Margot , developing a relationship with 30-something Robert through text messages , with hints there are small creepy deceptions playing out . Both Margot and the reader become suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says he is . When at one point Margot arrives at Robert 's house and feels pressured into sleeping with him , she is intimidated by their age gap , and mistakenly assumes he shares none of her shyness or nervousness . When she has sex with him out of a sense of guilt , or self-protection , female readers around the world felt an embarrassed recognition . Margot 's subsequent awkward attempts to extricate herself from any kind of relationship are met with Robert 's wrath . <p> Roupenian says the canary in the viral coalmine was her brother-in-law , a trusted friend with whom she shared the story after Treisman let her know it would be published . His reaction was completely different to what Roupenian expected . " I knew there was ambiguity in the story and I knew Robert was a shifting figure , " she says . " I wanted it to be genuinely unclear what his motivations were . But it seemed so clearly to me to be Margot 's story . And then my brother-in-law was like , ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supposed to read her mind ? ' And that was the first sign that it was a story people could have strong and definite opinions about . " <p> " A story that can be transparent enough that it lets you engage with it as though the characters are real -- that 's a thing that I want , that 's the stories that I read . " <p> Deconstructing the cause and effect of the story 's divisive reception became Roupenian 's " big intellectual project of the past year " . Reading hundreds of irate think pieces is " a strange way to encounter your own writing " . She attributes much of her own initial shock over the story 's success to the fact most people 's interpretations of " Cat Person " have n't reflected her aims as a short story writer . In the #MeToo context the story reads as confessional and realist , a feminist statement on warped millennial relationship dynamics in the vein of Lena Dunham 's Girls , or perhaps the 28-year-old Irish writer Sally Rooney 's novels Normal People and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30s , not her 20s , and she is n't especially obsessed with the dating lives of college girls and their bearded crushes . When her story went viral , she was living with her girlfriend , Callie , in Ann Arbor , Michigan . A lover of genre fiction , she initially conceived " Cat Person " as a horror story that homes in on the subtle perils of text messaging . <p> " I feel deeply and personally that sense of how strange it is , and how tempting it can be , to imagine a person based on just a handful of clues , " she says . " We need to pretend others are much more coherent and understandable than in our hearts we know that they are . " She says her larger intention with " Cat Person " , as with all of the stories in You Know You Want This , was to actively scare readers , to create a sense of " creeping dread " . She 's a fan of the visceral , she has a taste for blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen Maria Machado than Rooney . She also has a passion for Canadian writer Alice Munro , referring to her as the " mistress of discomfort , although she does n't always get talked about that way " . A short story at its best , Roupenian says , " is a single punch to the heart " . <p> Anyone looking for " Cat Person " sequels wo n't find them in You Know You Want This , but they will come across that same sinking sense of unease . " The Mirror , the Bucket , and the Old Thigh Bone " , an allegorical fairytale complete with princes , princesses and magic spells , has a morbid narrative twist and profoundly unhappy ending . In " Look at Your Game , Girl " a 12-year-old befriends a stranger in the local park who she thinks might be the next Charles Manson . There are some doomed millennial love stories in the book , but they 're far bleaker in scope than " Cat Person " . " Bad Boy " is the tale of an unhappy couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , and in " The Matchbox Sign " a young man realises his anxious girlfriend is far more unstable than she seems . She feared these twisted fables would n't be as easy a sell as " Cat Person " , especially as none had been published anywhere as prestigious as The New Yorker . " The temptation would be to turn the book into 11 stories about dating from the perspective of young women , " she says . " So I was grateful that editors recognised it was a weird , dark collection of essentially horror stories . They let it be what it was . " <p> Still , You Know You Want This contains a more recently written addition , included at her editor 's request . " The Good Guy " has themes adjacent to those of " Cat Person " but is , again , far scarier . Written from the perspective of an unhandsome man who grows increasingly resentful of the attractive female friends who sexually reject him , it will perhaps appease everybody who demanded justice for the overweight , unappealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideally ' The Good Guy ' could provide to men some of the uncomfortable satisfactions that ' Cat Person ' provided to women , " Roupenian says . " Here is this person that you 'd say you have nothing in common with , but then there 's this slow move into an uncomfortable familiarity or recognition . I do n't like this guy or endorse him , but ca n't say some of the feelings he has are n't feelings I 've had . " <p> Not that Roupenian is interested in catering to the grumpy male readers " Cat Person " stirred up online , suspicious of the author 's motives and irritated that their favourite literary magazine was concerning itself with the sex lives of college students . " There were men specifically saying , ' Oh , The New Yorker is publishing diary entries now . ' Which I think was less actual confusion and more a way of insulting a story that they found distasteful or annoying by reducing it to autobiography . It 's something that is really common , especially when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely never escape the story that made her an online sensation . She also wonders whether , if her literary success had happened more slowly , " I 'd feel more pride over my achievement , a sense of more control over my own trajectory . " But beyond the lucrative book deal , she says the most pleasing aspect in the reaction to " Cat Person " was the way straight women in their teens and 20s identified Margot 's anxieties as analogous to their own and began to talk publicly about their dating experiences en masse , dissecting every aspect of " Cat Person " until it became more real-life cautionary tale than fiction . " And that part of it I feel really good about , " Roupenian says . " A story that can be transparent enough that it lets you engage with it as though the characters are real -- that 's a thing that I want , that 's the stories that I read . " <p> A professor once told Roupenian that a writer 's responsibility is not to respond to events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the things that are happening " sink in and shape you " . Although she was n't thinking at all about politics while writing " Cat Person " , she 's now able to see how it 's steeped in a particular cultural moment . " When I wrote ' Cat Person ' , in the spring of 2017 , it was post-Trump , the news was so ugly , everyone was on edge about gender relations . There 's that sense of frustration and bleakness , and I can see in retrospect the fingerprints of what it felt like to be a woman in that particular moment all over that story . People responded to that . " <p> The spectacular way the story was shared and discussed in the mainstream beyond literary pages is another cause for optimism among short fiction authors . Short story collections rarely trouble bestseller lists . " When ' Cat Person ' went viral it was so funny , " Roupenian says , " because of course the thing about short stories is that they 're the least viral form that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what the ' Cat Person ' phenomenon asks is why ? Why are n't they ? In some ways they 're a perfect fit for the moment that we 're in and how we all tend to read now . " <p> As our attention spans wither in the face of clickbait and information overload , Roupenian thinks her form could yet gain greater relevance . She suspects she wo n't be the last short story writer to unexpectedly tap into the zeitgeist , especially as the zeitgeist gets sadder and stranger -- and weirder . " It 's less about writing new kinds of stories than it is the stories that have always been around finding the right audiences , " she says . " It feels like the internet could so easily facilitate that kind of matchmaking .

They 're based on " emissions inventories " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known sources of emissions . <p> They take into account the usual sources of emissions of an area : factories , power and heating plants , and cross-references them with meteorological variables . In other words , NASA would have had to introduce a " burning human bodies in crematoria " parameter . This is very unlikely . <p> NASA has not responded to Euronews ' requests for comment on this . <p> This type of forecast uses satellite data , but , in general , satellites are not able to detect small sources of sulphur dioxide such as factories or crematoria . They do accurately measure more intense phenomena such as volcanic eruptions . <p> So , if there were an intense , unusual emissions activity due to crematoria , it would n't be shown on these models . <h> Wuhan and Chongqing always have high levels of SO2 using the NASA model <p> The earth.nullschool application uses the same GEOS-5 NASA model . But it also has an archive of measures .

That 's unlikely , to say the least . <h> Factories and atmospheric conditions <p> Experts consulted by Euronews believe that the levels observed are not particularly alarming in one of the world 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular place may be related to atmospheric conditions .

@@71914241 <h> By incarcerating scholars , Modi-govt contradicts values of Hinduism <p> By Gurpreet Singh . Dated : 5/5/2020 12:11:20 AM <p> On the World Press Freedom Day , India has slipped on the global press freedom index.Reporters Without Borders has ranked it at 142 out of 180 countries , in light of recent attacks on journalists and scholars under a right wing Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government led by Narendra Modi.What could be more shameful for a country that claims to be the world 's largest democracy than this ? The news follows the recent incidents of slapping criminal charges against several journalists in different parts of the country in an attempt to suppress the voice of dissent and right to question.Only last month , well-respected columnist Anand Teltumbde was sent to jail on malicious charges for being critical of a government that wants to transform India into a Hindu theocracy and has given legitimacy to those involved in violence against religious minorities and other oppressed communities.Teltumbde has joined a few more thinkers already rotting in prisons .

Not only have the Indian government and its courts refused to set them free on humanitarian grounds , in spite of a grave threat of COVID 19 in overcrowded jails , they have ordered the arrests of others , such as Teltumbde.Ironically , the Modi government had recently started the broadcasting of Ramayan - a TV serial based on the epic of Lord Ram , a revered Hindu god - to entertain Indian masses locked in their homes because of COVID 19 . It is believed that Ram was the King of Ayodhya . Episode 13 of the serial ( posted on youtube ) shows that when Ram was designated as the king , his father had advised him to be respectful of scholars and intellectuals as they are like " guiding lights " and accept their criticism with an open mid.However , Modi 's government is doing exactly the opposite , despite its advocacy for a Hindu nation .

They have been claiming that the mosque was forcibly built on the birthplace of Ram by the Islamic rulers after demolishing a Hindu temple . Ram has become a rallying point for BJP to polarize Hindu majority.In complete contradiction of its own politics that revolves around Ram , this government is throwing scholars in jails , let alone the question of listening to their concerns . It 's time for the Hindus to step forward and challenge this government which is bent upon using their religion for narrow political ends , and show Modi and his hypocritical cabinet colleagues the mirror . If they really care for Ram , then they must liberate scholars and save democracy ; otherwise , history wo n't ever forget Modi and those who voted him to power in the name of a faith that teaches everyone to see the entire world as one big family. * ( Gurpreet Singh is a journalist )

@@85002241 <h> Honor our war dead this Memorial Day <p> With much of the nation shut down due to COVID-19 , one might not even remember Memorial Day . <p> The customary Memorial Day festivities of barbecues , beer , wearing white , traveling , and shopping will be truncated , if not arrested . But perhaps this is a sublime , unintended consequence of social distancing and sheltering at home orders if it settles our minds and let us focus on first things first -- actually giving Memorial Day its due . <p> Although there are many competing claims for its origin , the record is clear that Memorial Day began as " Decoration Day " near the end of the Civil War . Dedicated women and men would decorate the graves of the war 's fallen soldiers . The strewing of flowers on their tombs was a spontaneous affair , scattered throughout the country . No laws , resolutions , or executive orders spurred the adorners to action . <p> But a good idea 's power tends to spill over to broader society . Maj. Gen. John A.

For love of country they accepted death , and ... made immortal their patriotism and their virtue . " He also remarked that our history had made our " people unfit for despotism , " and the war dead sacrificed for freedom : " They must save their government or miserably perish . " <p> Logan 's order , the commemorations across the country , and Garfield 's stirring words created a strong foundation to firmly establish Decoration Day as an annual celebration -- held every May 30 .

By World War II , it was commonly referred to as Memorial Day . <p> Congress in the 1960s got the bright idea to create a three-day weekend , uprooting nearly a century of tradition , by shifting the date to the fourth Monday of May . With that change , much of the " memorial " was lost , and the travel season and other festivities began . <p> Frederick Douglass declared on Decoration Day in 1871 that if " our country has before it a long and glorious career of justice , liberty , and civilization , we are indebted to the unselfish devotion of the noble army who rest in these honored graves all around us .

In times as trying as a pandemic , a few extra minutes of lighthearted family feuding is n't terribly unwelcome .

In my five-plus decades I have witnessed astronauts walk on the moon , the fall of the Berlin Wall , 9/11 , and now COVID-19 . Life seems to change daily , and the feelings of uncertainty are almost palpable . And yet , in every crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the highest population of older people in the state , with 25% over 65 . As we have been repeatedly told , this demographic has been urged to limit exposure and practice " social distancing . " While being physically distant may be helpful , being isolated is not . Simultaneously Utah schools have been suspended , leaving parents and kids scrambling to keep occupied , safe , and hopefully academically engaged . I propose that at this moment in history , it is vital that the youth reach out to the elderly , and that the elderly share their wisdom with the young . <p> While parents make schedules for remote learning and try to carve the day into meaningful and manageable chunks , consider setting aside time for seniors . Though physical visits should be planned with discretion ( no toddlers in the nursing home ) , there are many ways to engage with grandparents or older neighbors in need of contact . Letters , cards , and drawings can be entertaining and educational . Several years back , to my dismay , I discovered that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue how to properly address an envelope and had written the address in one long line on the sealed side of the letter . Or set up grandpa 's device with FaceTime or Skype and have him read or tell stories daily to grandkids . My friend 's teenage daughters showed up at her mom 's senior condo with a karaoke machine , and sang " quarantunes . " Half the block came out to listen and kept thanking the girls for providing risk free entertainment -- from six feet away . <p> The elderly , in turn , can bolster the young . One of the findings that our research on girls and education shows us again and again is that key people can play a vital role in the educational aspirations and decisions of young women and girls . Girls who had relatives who talked to them about college and encouraged their goals were more likely to attend and graduate from college . One respondent credited the example of her grandmother as her biggest motivator : " When she was 70 , she wanted to learn a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could speak it fluently . " Imagine the impact if , during this time of being homebound , each senior reached out to a young woman in their life and nurtured educational aspirations . Pick a novel and start a virtual book group , hire a local teen to run your errands and stipulate that part of the money goes to college savings , research a topic of mutual interest , and teach each other via FaceTime . <p> Isolation in the elderly is linked to several health risks . In our desire to keep the older population safe , we must find ways to stay emotionally close while maintaining physical distance . And the antidote may be in connecting them with a group who are also hungering for support and direction -- the young , specifically young women and girls . Even in crisis , we can find connection . <p> Dr. Susan R. Madsen is the Orin R.

Difficult enough with a 16 page disclosure statement and that was just to deposit funds clearly from the sale of a house ; imagine the difficulty if the trust was to purchase a property with some beneficiaries living overseas and the FBB .

" Porteous said . " Without regional and national public health data on covid-19 infections in health care personnel , it is difficult to envision how to start answering this question . " <p> During the SARS outbreak , Porteous said , data about " an alarmingly high rate of infection and death " in medical staff led to improved rules around infection protocol and use of personal protective equipment . <p> Ruth Schubert , spokeswoman for the Washington Nurses Association , said that same data is needed for covid-19 . <p> " We are urging the Department of Health and the emergency operations team at the state level to begin collecting and reporting this information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the coronavirus will impact the country 's health care system say they also want the data to better determine how severely hospitals will be affected . <p> While health officials count ICU beds and calculate hospital capacity to plan for a surge in cases , Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , has created a model for predicting covid-19 deaths . It also predicts the number of hospital beds , ICU beds and ventilators each state will need . <p> Murray is also trying to include things like how many workers are needed to care for patients .

But if a worker was exposed and did n't have symptoms or even tested negative , they 're required to be quarantined 14 days . <p> A Section on 04/06/2020 <p> Print Headline : States lack data on number of health care workers testing positive <p> ADVERTISEMENT <h> Sponsor Content <p> COMMENTS - It looks like you 're using Internet Explorer , which is n't compatible with the Democrat-Gazette commenting system .

In seeking to bolster adaptability , a lot of this must be crafted within a clear communication landscape , be it with clients , staff , partners or stakeholders .

@@71727641 <p> Board of Education chair Janice Tenorio fears that once the injunction to enforce the CNMI Supreme Court 's ruling is carried out , it would cause a ripple effect , inevitable crippling the entire CNMI in the process . <p> BOE voted 3-2 during a special board meeting last Wednesday on a motion to file an injunction against the CNMI government regarding the funds owed to the Public School System . <p> According to Tenorio , she strongly disagrees with the decision to carry out the injunction to sue parties within the central government at this time , considering the lack of revenue coming in following the novel coronavirus outbreak , because the entire CNMI is suffering following the recent outbreak of COVID-2019 . <p> Tenorio added that the central government has always been a partner of the educational system , a sibling even , and by filing the injunction while the economy is down , is like " fighting with a helpless sibling " and " pulling at each other 's hair .

The injunction we are asking is wrong timing , we could at least defer the injunction until our government is back on its feet .

Are we essential to this government or not , if not , then close the schools . If you can not afford this institution , then shut it down .

" By the time you are able to develop a medical counter-measure , the virus would have done significant damage . " <p> But getting the message of behavior change across to locals is not so simple given cultural or even religious nuances . <p> Amid the Ebola outbreak in Liberia , with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of burial rites , it took the country 's head Imam going on national radio to discuss the issue before significant change was noticed . " The government could have gone on radio as many times as we wanted but it would n't have been enough to alter people 's behavior , " says Moore , who was a government minister at the time . " It 's about finding repositories of trust and incorporating them into your incidence response system . " <p> AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville <p> Fighting with information . <p> Optimizing authority figures to get the message serves a double-purpose of changing social behavior and winning the public over as allies to supplement weak health systems especially where gaps in surveillance and patient tracking can worsen the outbreak , as seen in Sierra Leone . " The initial surveillance system in Sierra Leone was not enough to contain the disease and there was an escalation , " says Ibeneme who spent six months in the country as response team lead for the African Union . " That escalation made surveillance even more delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible behavior changes now better understood , especially in the countries worst affected by Ebola , chances are locals will now be far more receptive . And there 's already some early-day evidence to support that notion : " There 's more awareness and people are more proactive now , " Fallah says . " As bad as Ebola was , it was also a learning process and you can see that now . " <h> Getting set <p> Ultimately , not all African countries can reflect on direct Ebola lessons and suffering one viral outbreak does n't exactly render a country immune from another -- as DR Congo 's 10th and ongoing Ebola outbreak shows . Given close travel and trade links to China , African countries still broadly remain at risk . <p> For the best outcomes in a viral outbreak , " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react . " <p> To ensure the best possible outcome in the event of an outbreak , African countries must prepare for the worst . " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react , " Moore says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we knew of outbreaks that had happened in the past and , when the outbreak exceeded anything that had happened before , we were grossly unprepared . " Where they do n't exist already , preparedness should begin with selecting sites and locations for temporary hospital set-ups to isolate and treat patients and kicking off awareness campaigns early , Moore says . <p> But given the reality of underfunded health systems across the continent , preparedness levels often mirror financial capabilities . And that 's where global bodies like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) matter . " Putting funding into this stage of preparation efforts across Africa will be the best investment at this stage , " Fallah says . For its part , WHO also has some learning to do in that regard having faced widespread criticism for its slow response to the Ebola crisis in 2014 . <p> Reuters/Francis Kokoroko <p> Officials at Accra 's international airport on alert to screen passengers in the wake of coronavirus outbreak . <p> As African countries look to learn from what worked during the Ebola crisis , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . " We tried to quarantine entire communities like we see China doing now but that proved counter productive because you have to engage them , " says Moore .

" <p> Just like during the Ebola outbreak , countries will likely be tempted to insulate themselves as an instinctive protective measure but the chances of ending the outbreaks hinge on collaboration rather than isolation , Moore adds : " These outbreaks end if the response is collective , not individual "

The company is withdrawing its full year guidance due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Information about TE Connectivity 's use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided below . For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures , see the attached tables . <p> Conference Call and WebcastThe company will hold a conference call today beginning at 8:30 a.m . ET . The dial-in information is provided here : <p> By telephone : For both " listen-only " participants and those participants who wish to take part in the question-and-answer portion of the call , the dial-in number in the United States is ( 866 ) 211-4092 , and for international callers , the dial-in number is ( 647 ) 689-6620 . <p> A replay of the conference call will be available on TE Connectivity 's investor website at investors.te.com at 11:30 a.m . ET on April 28 , 2020 . <p> Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe present non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider adjusted financial measures in addition to results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( " GAAP " ) . These non-GAAP financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for results in accordance with GAAP . Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company . We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance , ability to generate cash , and the trends of our business . Additionally , we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations . The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results . This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts , character , and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts . These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies . <p> * Organic Net Sales Growth ( Decline ) -- represents net sales growth ( decline ) ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign currency exchange rates , and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months , if any . Organic Net Sales Growth ( Decline ) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management 's control , such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates , and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company , such as acquisition and divestiture activity . This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans . <p> * Adjusted Operating Income ( Loss ) and Adjusted Operating Margin -- represent operating income ( loss ) and operating margin , respectively , ( the most comparable GAAP financial measures ) before special items including restructuring and other charges , acquisition-related charges , impairment of goodwill , and other income or charges , if any . We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income ( loss ) and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions . Adjusted Operating Income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation plans . <p> * Adjusted Other Income ( Expense ) , Net -- represents net other income ( expense ) ( the most comparable GAAP financial measure ) before special items including tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other items , if any . <p> * Adjusted Income Tax ( Expense ) Benefit and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate -- represent income tax ( expense ) benefit and effective tax rate , respectively , ( the most comparable GAAP financial measures ) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges , acquisition-related charges , impairment of goodwill , other income or charges , and certain significant tax items , if any . <p> * Adjusted Income ( Loss ) from Continuing Operations -- represents income ( loss ) from continuing operations ( the most comparable GAAP financial measure ) before special items including restructuring and other charges , acquisition-related charges , impairment of goodwill , tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items , other income or charges , and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable , the related tax effects . <p> * Adjusted Earnings ( Loss ) Per Share -- represents diluted earnings ( loss ) per share from continuing operations ( the most comparable GAAP financial measure ) before special items including restructuring and other charges , acquisition-related charges , impairment of goodwill , tax sharing income related to adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items , other income or charges , and certain significant tax items , if any , and , if applicable , the related tax effects . This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans . <p> * Free Cash Flow ( FCF ) -- is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash . The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities ( the most comparable GAAP financial measure ) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify . We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items , if any , minus net capital expenditures . Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity . Certain special items , including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and cash paid ( collected ) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts , are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow . Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property , plant , and equipment . These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments . <p> In the calculation of Free Cash Flow , we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management 's and the Board of Directors ' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates . It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures , such as debt payments . In addition , we may have other discretionary expenditures , such as discretionary dividends , share repurchases , and business acquisitions , that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow . <p> Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains certain " forward-looking statements " within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .

The same goes for the remaining winter championship tournaments and spring championship tournaments -- including the College World Series for baseball and softball . <p> " This decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat , our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to the spread of the pandemic , and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities , " the NCAA statement said . <p> Early Thursday afternoon , the Big 12 conference announced all regular season competitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are suspended beginning Friday through March 29 .

" I feel particularly bad for the players . <p> " In the interest in heeding the advice we were hearing ... cancellation was the right outcome . " <p> The Big 12 's decision was made following a chaotic morning which saw other conferences cancel their tournaments like dominoes in the fluid response to the COVID-19 outbreak .

The Red Raiders and Lady Raiders basketball teams were slated for an early afternoon flight back to Lubbock . <p> The Red Raiders ( 18-13 ) , including its two graduate transfers TJ Holyfield and Chris Clarke , will see their season end without a chance to snap a four-game losing streak . The Longhorns ( 19-12 ) , who do not have any seniors on the team , will conclude their season following a loss to Oklahoma State . <p> " We did n't have anybody say , ' I do n't want to play .

MT April 13 , 2020 <p> CLOSE <p> The world reached two somber milestones this Thursday . There have now been more than 1 million reported cases of covid-19 , the pandemic disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus . Las Cruces Sun-News <p> SANTA FE - The Republican Party urged New Mexico Gov . Michelle Lujan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow certain nonessential small businesses to reopen with some requirements for social distancing . <p> Speaking on a virtual press conference with small business owners , GOP Chair Steve Pearce said new restrictions are unfairly hurting small " mom and pop " shops while allowing big box stores like Walmart to continue operating . <p> The first-term Democratic governor and state health officials have suspended a variety of nonessential businesses through at least April 30 to slow the spread of the coronavirus and ensure health care facilities are not overwhelmed by a surge of patients . <p> Pearce said the precautions are too drastic and put small businesses in jeopardy of financial ruin . " Somewhere the Main Street owners of mom and pop stores in New Mexico need to be spoke for , " Pearce said . <p> Closed stores are shown at a central plaza and shopping district amid a public health order that has closed down most retail stores and suspended dine-in restaurant service in Santa Fe , N.M. , Friday , March 27 , 2020 . ( Photo : Morgan Lee/AP ) <p> Lujan Grisham said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy while putting the highest priority on public health and safety . <p> A list of essential businesses that can remain open includes industries that attend to health care , emergency services , law enforcement , food supplies , energy , construction , internet service , data centers , some manufacturing , and care for the indigent , elderly and young children whose parents work . <p> Recent revisions to the restrictions placed new limits on the operation of liquor stores and storefront loan businesses . <p> Shelly Quartieri , owner of the Colfax Tavern &amp; Diner in Maxwell , said she understood restrictions were needed , but felt restrictions should be imposed statewide in the same way . <p> " Social distancing should be based on population and cases , " said Quartieri , who recently was forced to lay off her husband . " It 's not a cookie-cutter world . " <p> Quartieri and other small business owners pressed Lujan Grisham to allow them to reopen " with fair restrictions . " <p> The National Rifle Association and allied businesses have sued the state , alleging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shooting ranges as nonessential businesses . Firearms are still sold at some feed and hardware stores . <p> Jessica Carothers , 43 , who owns three beauty salons in Albuquerque and supports Lujan Grisham 's measures , said she understands that small businesses want to reopen and the effects the closures are having on revenue . <p> " Nobody wants to reopen more than I do , " Carothers said . " But I ca n't in good conscience put my clients and employees at risk right now . " <p> New Mexico has reported more than 1,240 coronavirus cases with 26 deaths . It is mainly spread through coughs and sneezes . For most people , it causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough , that clear up in two to three weeks . For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .

@@51411941 <h> China Oil Demand Has Plunged 20% Because of the Virus Lockdown <p> ( Bloomberg ) -- Chinese oil demand has dropped by about 3 million barrels a day , or 20% of total consumption , as the coronavirus squeezes the economy , according to people with inside knowledge of the country 's energy industry . <p> The drop is probably the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 , and the most sudden since the Sept. 11 attacks . It could force the hand of OPEC and its allies , which are considering an emergency meeting to cut production and staunch the decline in prices . <p> " It is truly a black swan event for the oil market , " said John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York . " There was some hope for the demand outlook this year before the outbreak , but that has been knocked off its block . OPEC+ has to react . If there are no further production cuts , there will only be more price losses . " <p> Crude futures fell to one-year lows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health crisis in China . Brent , the global oil benchmark , dropped 1.3% to $55.91 a barrel as of 1:53 p.m. in London . West Texas Intermediate declined as much as 2.2% , and traded 0.5% lower at $51.33 . <p> China is the world 's largest oil importer , after surpassing the U.S. in 2016 , so any change in consumption has an outsize impact on the global energy market . The country consumes about 14 million barrels a day -- equivalent to the combined needs of France , Germany , Italy , Spain , the U.K. , Japan and South Korea . <p> Chinese and Western oil executives , speaking on condition of anonymity because they are n't authorized to discuss the matter publicly , said the decline was measured against normal levels for this time of year . It 's a measure of the current drop in demand , rather than the average loss since the crisis started , which would be smaller . <p> Beijing has locked millions of people in quarantine and the New Year holiday has been extended . Flights have been canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus 's spread . Traditionally during the New Year holiday , gasoline and jet-fuel demand increase as hundred of millions go back home , while gasoil consumption drops as industrial activity slows . <p> The collapse in Chinese oil consumption is starting to reverberate across the global energy market , with sales of some crudes slowing to a crawl and benchmark prices in free-fall . Sales of Latin American oil cargoes to China came to a halt last week , while sales of West African crude , a traditional source for Chinese refineries , are also slower than usual , traders said . <p> Chinese refineries are storing unsold petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel , according to the executives . But stockpiles are growing every day , and some refineries may soon reach their storage limits . If that were to happen , they would have to cut the amount of crude they process . One executive said that refinery runs were likely to be cut soon by 15-20% . <p> There are signs that 's already happening . Sinopec Group , the nation 's biggest refiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants by an average of about 13-15% and will review whether further cuts are needed Feb. 9 , according to one of the people . The company declined to comment on its operations . <p> As many as 18 independent oil refineries may be cutting rates or shutting completely as storage fills up , according to traders familiar with operations at the plants known as teapots . China has as many as 40 of these independent refineries , which are located primarily in the eastern region of Shandong and account for about a quarter of the nation 's processing capacity . <p> Beyond the headline price for Brent , every other indicator in the physical and derivatives market also points to a weakening market . So-called time-spreads , which measure the price difference between contracts for delivery at different times , have collapsed -- an indication that short-term demand is expected to remain weak . <p> In China , stocks plummeted by the most since an equity bubble burst in 2015 as they resumed trading to the worsening virus outbreak . The CSI 300 Index slumped as much as 9.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 23 , while the yuan tumbled and crude futures in Shanghai also sank by more than 7% . <p> OPEC and its allies , which include Russia , are weighing their options to respond to the crisis and there have been discussions about calling an emergency meeting . Saudi Arabia is pressing for a gathering sooner than the one scheduled for March 5-6 , though it has run into resistance from Russia . The Saudi and Russian oil ministers spoke on the phone for an hour on Thursday and another 30 minutes on Friday , according to Russians officials . <p> For now , OPEC has called a technical meeting this week to assess the situation , and the Joint Technical Committee will report back to ministers . <p> According to consultants at Energy Aspects Ltd. , OPEC is considering an informal proposal to deepen current production curbs by about 500,000 barrels a day . But there 's no consensus on the idea , which was floated by at least one country . As OPEC and its partners are already in the midst of steep cuts , many analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> The most recent agreed reductions only came together after considerable diplomatic wrangling , and Saudi Arabia has already slashed production to the lowest since 2014 . Russia , which has become the most important producer in the coalition alongside the kingdom , has typically taken some persuading to sign up to additional cuts . Still , if the alliance does agree to call an early meeting , historic precedent suggests it will probably result in action . <p> " Nothing concentrates a producer 's mind more than the prospect of a crude oil price bust , " said Bob McNally , president of Rapidan Energy Group , and a former White House oil official under President George W.

Phil Jones , Senior Photographer , Augusta University <p> Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia ( MCG ) are developing an artificial intelligence ( AI ) -aided coronavirus phone app to help individuals get a fast , at-home risk assessment based on how they feel and where they 've been , and direct those who are calculated to be at risk of coronavirus infection to the nearest testing facility . <p> The app , which could be available within the next few weeks , will also provide local and public health officials with additional real-time information on the emerging demographics of those most at risk of coronavirus infection . This will help to better target prevention and treatment initiatives , reported Arni S.R. Srinivasa Rao , PhD , director of the Laboratory for Theory and Mathematical Modeling in the MCG Division of Infectious Diseases at Augusta University ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the MCG Division of Infectious Diseases . Rao and Vazquez are working with developers to finalize the app , which will be free because it addresses a public health concern . Rao is corresponding author of a report on development of the app , which is published in the journal Infection Control &amp; Hospital Epidemiology , and titled , " Identification of COVID-19 Can be Quicker through Artificial Intelligence framework using a Mobile Phone-Based Survey in the Populations when Cities/Towns Are Under Quarantine . " <p> Rao said , " We wanted to help identify people who are at high risk for coronavirus , help expedite their access to screening and to medical care , and reduce the spread of this infectious disease . " As the authors noted , " It is imperative that we evaluate novel models in an attempt to control the rapidly spreading virus ... In order to reduce the time to identification of a person under investigation ( PUI ) for the COVID-19 infection , and the rapid isolation of this individual , we propose to collect the basic travel history along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The app will ask for basic demographic details , including where the individual lives , their gender , age , and race , and for information on recent contact with any individual who is known to have coronavirus , or who has traveled to areas such as Italy and China that have witnessed a relatively high incidence of the viral infection in the last 14 days . <p> Users will also be asked about common symptoms of infection and duration , including fever , cough , shortness of breath , fatigue , sputum production , headache , diarrhea , and pneumonia . The app will , in addition , collect similar information for individuals who live with the user but who can not fill out their own survey . <p> The artificial intelligence framework will then use an algorithm that Rao has developed to rapidly assess the information , and send the individual a risk assessment -- i.e. , no risk , minimal risk , moderate , or high risk -- and alert the nearest testing facility if a health check is likely needed .

" The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier , thus decreasing the chance of spread . " Conversely , the authors noted , if a respondent is at no immediate risk of having symptoms or signs related to the viral infection , then the AI-based health alert will be sent to notify them that there is no current risk of COVID-2019 . <p> The collective information of many individuals will aid rapid and accurate identification of regions , including cities , counties , towns , and villages , where the virus is showing prevalence , and help to indicate the relative risk in that region so healthcare facilities and providers can better prepare the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more about how the virus is spreading . Once the app is ready , it will live on the augusta.edu domain and likely in app stores on the iOS and Android platforms . <p> Technology can assist faster identification of possible cases and aid timely intervention , the investigators suggested , noting that the coronavirus app could be easily adapted for other infectious diseases . The accessibility and rapidity of the app coupled with machine intelligence means it could also be utilized for screening wherever large crowds gather , such as major sporting events . " Apart from cost-effectiveness , the proposed modeling will be of great assistance in identifying and controlling when populations are closed due to virus spread , " the authors stated . " In addition to these , our proposed algorithm can be easily extended to identify individuals who might have any mild symptoms and signs .

However , Vazquez noted , " This is what you have to do with pandemics . You do n't want to expose an infected person to an uninfected person . " If problems with infections persist and grow , drive-thru testing sites may be another need , he commented . <p> The investigators hope that a readily available method to assess an individual 's risk will actually help to suppress any developing panic over the COVID-19 infection .

FDA has also given permission for some of the more sophisticated academic labs , including those at Augusta University Medical Center , to use their own methods to look for signs of the viral infection , and this is something that the hospital will be pursuing . People presenting at the emergency department at AU Medical Center with concerns about the virus are brought in by a separate entrance and are escorted to a negative pressure room by employees dressed in hazmat suits , in accordance with CDC protocols , Vazquez said . As of March 5 , all those who had presented at AU Medical Center had tested negative .

@@71917741 <h> Tackling future Covids : Three things India needs to learn from China <p> We have an excellent disaster preparedness machinery . But it 's time to have a disease preparedness system as well . <p> Employees are back at work at the construction site of the Wuhan Greenland Center , a 636-m high skyscraper in Wuhan in China 's central Hubei province . ( AFP ) <p> China 's approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus has been called many things , many contradictory things . Just for instance , the strict lockdown and aggressive social distancing measures have been termed draconian ; at the same time , the measures adopted in Wuhan , which were nothing but lockdown and social distancing , have been called effective as well . So when we in India look at how China wrested control over the coronavirus outbreak , we do so in part admiration at Beijing 's ruthless efficiency , and part alarm at the disregard for citizen liberties . <p> While ideological differences over civil liberties will always separate India and China , New Delhi would do well to look hard at the measures enforced by Beijing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters into a key phase of its own battle against the novel coronavirus nCoV19 , it would benefit immensely from the insights available from the Chinese experience . <p> The most important of such insights would be that China did not win its battle with one fell blow . If one became aware of the coronavirus outbreak only when China employed all its state power to quarantine Wuhan and no less than 12 neighbouring cities , one might be misled into believing that one sledgehammer blow was all that it took to gain an upper hand on the epidemic . In fact , China did not use one single measure or policy : it adopted multifaceted and calibrated containment tactics based on an epidemic combat strategy finessed over 15 years . <p> Here are three things that China did that we can learn from as we go into the most crucial phase of the coronavirus epidemic in India . <p> 1 . Nationwide disease surveillance infrastructure <p> In China , measures to detect vicious outbreaks such as Covid-19 were put in place right after the SARS outbreak in 2003 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as 2004 . Called the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System ( NIDRIS ) , it is a web-based system for health facilities to report , in real time , individual case information of 39 notifiable infectious diseases . The NIDRIS system tracks approximately 5 million cases each year . The database connects hospitals and clinics at the prefecture , county , provincial and national levels , allowing the China Centre for Disease Control ( CDC ) to monitor an outbreak at every level . <p> Besides incidence reporting , China 's surveillance infrastructure includes an early warning system to detect the unusual occurrence of 33 infectious diseases . Set up by the WHO and China CDC in 2008 , the China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System ( CIDARS ) facilitates the transmission of surveillance data in real time or on a daily basis . The 33 diseases in CIDARS are classified as Type 1 ( high severity but low incidence ) or Type 2 ( common infectious diseases ) . CIDARS tracks diseases that are outbreak-prone and transmits information about any abnormal signals to the CDCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four components : aberration detection , signal generation , signal dissemination and signal response information feedback . <p> How does this system work ? Since lower respiratory infections including pneumonia are one of the main causes of death worldwide , all Chinese healthcare facilities are required to report any patient who has a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown etiology and meets the following criteria : fever &gt;= 38 degrees C ; radiological characteristics of pneumonia ; normal or reduced leucocyte count or low lymphocyte count ; no improvement/worsening of patient 's condition for first 3-5 days ; and the pneumonia can not be attributed to alternative laboratory or clinical diagnosis . <p> After a case is registered in NIDRIS , the data can be further analysed in CIDARS as a Type 1 disease . Early alert signals are sent out when the number of cases exceeds the threshold for each infection . The thresholds for each disease are recommended by China CDC . Early warnings in the form of real-time SMSs are followed by a field investigation to rule out avian influenza , SARS and MERS . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all epidemic staff at CDCs at the national , provincial , city and county levels . <p> It may be true that in spite of having the infrastructure outlined above , China was slow to respond when the Wuhan outbreak happened . In fact , several studies of China 's disease surveillance infrastructure point out that although physicians are required to report pneumonia of unknown etiology , there is evidence of under-reporting . However , the purpose of the system is to detect clusters of pneumonia that indicate an outbreak . It gives the administration a better chance to react fast . <p> In contrast , India 's disease surveillance infrastructure is coordinated through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme ( IDSP ) but is beset with limitations . According to a roundtable discussion between healthcare experts organised by Carnegie India in December 2019 , the disease surveillance infrastructure model in India lacks uniformity of case definitions , standards and practices at the state and national levels . Also , there was a lack of coordination among competing organisations that resulted in ineffective disease mapping . Additionally , a research article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data on infectious disease burden in India . <p> In any scenario , there is consensus on what ought to be India 's biggest learning from the coronavirus experience : invest heavily in disease surveillance at all levels . <p> 2 . Contact tracing <p> In the current coronavirus crisis , digital surveillance and data analytics have emerged as important tools in epidemic control . China was fortunate in this matter , and gained time by turning to the massive amounts of data collected by companies like Tencent and Alibaba to perform contact tracing . These companies actually have a better idea of population and migration patterns than the Chinese government . Leveraging this data enabled orderly contact tracing of infected citizens and at-risk individuals . <p> On the other hand , many countries battling the coronavirus have given up on contact tracing fairly quickly although it is an effective , inexpensive and very basic public health intervention , compared to policies like social distancing , which have great economic costs . <p> Measures to trace the location and movement of millions of mobile phone users were put into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alibaba and Tencent . For instance , Ant Financial 's QR code system assigns users one of three colors -- green , yellow or red -- based on the user 's basic healthcare information , travel history and location . The close-contact detector apps use big data from public authorities about train and air travel history and disease case records to check if the user has been in contact with an infected person . A green code permits freedom of movement , while yellow and red indicate that the user must self-quarantine or enter supervised quarantine . The right of admission into cafes , malls and other establishments is conditional on what code you have been assigned at that moment . <p> 3 . Mobility Controls <p> Beijing 's initial response to the Wuhan outbreak is being questioned but the agility of its action in that city in the third week of January is widely acknowledged . After more than 100 cases were detected on January 21 , mobility controls were announced in Wuhan on January 23 : the airport was closed ; bus , subway and train services were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . The lockdown measures were put in place days before the Chinese New Year holiday , when millions of people travel around and out of the country . By 24 January , travel restrictions were extended to 12 prefecture-level cities in Hubei . <p> In a study published in the journal Science , researchers estimated that the lockdown and mobility controls prevented 700,000 additional coronavirus cases and gave 130 cities extra time ( 3-5 days ) to prepare for the outbreak . The scale and agility of the lockdown involving 60 million people in Hubei has been the subject of much awe , but mobility controls went beyond a lockdown . <p> Keeping people indoors meant supplying supermarkets and stores with enough food to ensure people did n't have to leave their homes . In India , we have witnessed the exodus of millions of migrant labourers shortly after a lockdown was announced because they were not assured of food , residence and essential services in the cities . Anticipating that people would hoard food items and venture out of their homes in search of essentials , the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubei . <p> The city of Shouguang , in Shandong , is the country 's most important hub for growing , trading and shipping vegetables . The city is critical to China 's food production and distribution , so much so that the daily benchmark of national produce costs is called the China Shouguang Vegetable Price Index . Shouguang produces 4.5 million tonnes of vegetables every year and even more produce moves through its wholesale markets to reach other parts of China . Shouguang activated emergency plans to continue producing and delivering vegetables into Wuhan after it was asked to deliver 600 tonnes of fresh vegetables to Wuhan everyday for two weeks starting on 29 January . Officials also coordinated with provinces around Hubei to amass a reserve of 60,000 tonnes of vegetables and readied 10,000 tonnes of frozen pork in Shanghai that could be sent to Wuhan anytime . To facilitate the distribution of fresh produce , the government exempted food delivery trucks from travel restrictions and cracked down on price gouging at supermarkets in Wuhan . <p> The author is a China scholar and former research officer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

So it 's not surprising that Harvard was at the center of a dispute Wednesday in which Trump administration officials sought to embarrass universities with big endowments for considering taking federal stimulus funds meant to help needy students . <p> Wednesday afternoon , 24 hours after President Trump predicted at a news conference that " Harvard 's going to pay back the money " and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urged institutions " with large endowments " to forgo funds from the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund , the university announced that it would , indeed , do just that . <p> The university will face " significant financial challenges " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it neither requested nor received any funds awarded through the congressionally approved program , its officials said in a statement . But " we are ... concerned ... that the intense focus by politicians and others on Harvard in connection with this program may undermine participation in a relief effort that Congress created and the President signed into law for the purpose of helping students and institutions whose financial challenges in the coming months may be most severe . " <p> The CARES Act , which Congress approved in March as an initial attempt to blunt the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic , included roughly $12 billion in funding for higher education , split about equally between funds for students displaced by the pandemic and for institutions facing unexpected costs . The law 's formula -- " purely mechanical , " as one higher education lobbyist pointed out -- allocated the money for students to colleges based on how many low-income students they enroll , and the money for the institutions based on their enrollments of full-time students . <p> In recent days , conservative websites had criticized Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in line to receive . Harvard was allocated $8.6 million . Tuesday evening , President Trump joined the fray , bringing up Harvard in response to a question about the flow of money from a different stimulus program designed to help small businesses survive the coronavirus-driven economic shutdown . <p> " They have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country , maybe in the world , I guess , and they 're going to pay back that money , " the president said . <p> That led Harvard to respond in a war of words of sorts with the president -- via Twitter , perhaps appropriately enough . <p> " President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses , " the university said , noting that it was in line for funds from the higher education relief fund . <p> " Harvard has committed that 100 percent of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on top of the support the university has already provided to students -- including assistance with travel , providing direct aid for living expenses to those with need and supporting students ' transition to online education . " <p> Wednesday morning , though , DeVos -- echoing the sentiments of an April 9 letter to college and university presidents -- issued a statement saying that " wealthy institutions that do not primarily serve low-income students do not need or deserve additional taxpayer funds . " She also urged Congress to change its rules for distributing the stimulus funds . " This is common sense . Schools with large endowments should not apply for funds so more can be given to students who need support the most . " <p> DeVos did not single Harvard out by name . But she praised Stanford University , which earlier Wednesday had announced that it would forgo the stimulus funds , even though , " like all universities , Stanford is facing significant financial pressures during this time of unprecedented uncertainty . However , we realize that this crisis represents an existential threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a critical part of the fabric of higher learning in the United States .

They should follow Stanford 's lead &amp; embrace the @ShakeShack principle -- leave the $$ for those with the greatest need ! <p> Princeton University , another of the wealthiest universities in the country , followed suit later Wednesday afternoon , though with a twist . Its statement said that the university would not accept funding allocated under the CARES Act , and specifically mentioned its need to support students who are in the U.S. without proper documentation , whom the Trump administration determined Tuesday would be ineligible for the emergency aid . <p> Late Wednesday afternoon , perhaps boxed into a corner by its peers , Harvard conceded that it , too , had " decided not to seek or accept the funds allocated to it by statute . " <p> " We will inform the Department of Education of our decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated to Harvard , " university officials said . " While we understand any reallocation of these resources is a matter for the Department of Education , we hope that special consideration will be given to Massachusetts institutions that are struggling to serve their communities and meet the needs of their students through these difficult and challenging times . " <p> Politics or Policy ? <p> Iris Palmer , a senior adviser for higher education and workforce in the education program at New America , a Washington think tank , said administration officials were " not wrong that Harvard can afford to provide for all their needy students without federal money . " She called Harvard a " politically convenient punching bag " for politicians like President Trump . <p> But she noted that the lines are not clear-cut about which institutions might be deserving , and not , of stimulus funds . While Harvard was certainly due more money than many of its surrounding community colleges , the congressionally approved formula allocates funds for institutions ( as opposed to the money directed to students ) in part to compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential colleges more than commuter institutions . <p> And while Harvard 's endowment may strike many observers as unequivocally too large to warrant receiving taxpayer money , " how far down the endowment list " do you say that ? Palmer said . " That 's why this is more of a political question than a policy question . " <p> An official of a major research university said it was " totally predictable " that the Trump administration would use the current situation for an " attack " on prestigious universities . Every wealthy university would essentially be a " pass-through " for the funds to its financially neediest students , the official said , citing numerous students whose " summer earnings are not going to happen , or whose families ' financial circumstances have changed for the worse . " <p> " Of course you 're going to help your neediest students , " the university representative said . " And you 'll use whatever money that frees up to maybe help students who are n't the absolute neediest neediest ... or maybe loosen up some money so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus.

@@84913041 <p> COLUMBIA- Senator Josh Hawley , R-Missouri , was the focus of an announcement Thursday morning by Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner , who said he is teaming up with Hawley to work on a plan to help business recover from the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> In an interview with KOMU 8 News Thursday morning , Hawley said the proposal will incentivize business to rehire workers who were laid off in the pandemic . It would cover a percentage of wages for every worker currently on payroll through the end of the year . <p> Hawley said jobs need to be the number one priority for congress . <p> " People do n't want to be sidelined in the unemployment line . They want work , " Hawley said . " Our economy will continue to hemorrhage unless Congress gets serious about ways to rehire workers and get Americans working again . " <p> Hawley spoke with KOMU 8 's Daniel Perreault in a wide-ranging--but short--conversation . They discussed his proposal for rehiring workers , the " HEROES Act " stimulus package proposed by House Democrats , COVID-19 testing and the future of the U-S China relationship . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> PERREAULT : Let 's see what we can get through the next five minutes here . I was watching the Senate hearing on Monday or Tuesday of this week , there was lot of talk about testing and the importance of it . So how do you think the US doing on testing ? <p> SENATOR HAWLEY : Well , I think that we 've done great so far . I mean , we 've done as well as we can do , but we need to do more . I mean , this is one of those things that you do n't get the grade on the paper until it 's all done , right ? So we 've got to do more . I think the state of Missouri in particular has been working very hard in order to do testing . And we 've done a lot more than a lot of other states . But one of the reasons I have asked FEMA over and over for more tests for the state of Missouri , more protective equipment for our frontline health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that Missouri wants to do five , 10 times the number of tests . We 've got the lab capacity in the state to do five to 10 times the number of tests a day that we 're currently doing now , but we just need more kits . This is one of the reasons why , again , I 've asked the federal government to prioritize Missouri . It 's also a reason why we need to bring supply chains back to this country , so we 're not dependent on other countries to make the components for our ventilators , for our test kits . We need to make that stuff here so we can ramp up production and do all we need to do . <p> PERREAULT : There has been a lot of talk on Capitol Hill about another stimulus package . This week , the Democrats rolled out their next stimulus package--or at least what they want to see in it . What are your thoughts on that ? <p> SEN . HAWLEY : I thought that the Democrats ' package is $3 trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for workers . It 's exactly the wrong approach . With unemployment--36 million people have claimed unemployment benefits in the last two months . We 've got unemployment up near 20 percent and what they want to do is is bailout California and Illinois . No thanks . What I 've done is put forward my own plan that focuses on workers . It would allow every business in this country to rehire workers who have been laid off because of COVID-19 . It would help protect every job in this country for the duration of this emergency . That 's what we ought to be doing . We ought to be securing people 's jobs . We ought to be getting them their job security . And , by the way , the healthcare that comes along with that , that ought to be our focus . And if you want to talk about reopening the economy , the way you reopen the economy is you get people to work . <p> PERREAULT : You know , how do you explain to folks who are back home here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , B , or C , maybe , you know , their businesses are n't reopened yet , they 're not getting a paycheck--what 's your message to them ? <p> SEN . HAWLEY : Well , my message to them is we 've got to get your job security . I mean , we 've got to make sure that you have a job to go back to . And this is why I think it is so vitally important that Congress focus on jobs . If you want to get the economy powered back up , get people their jobs back . Even if they live in an area of our state or other places in the country where they ca n't physically go back to work yet , they can still have their job , they can still know that they 've got it . They can still have the security that comes from having a job and everything else that comes with it , the benefits that come with it . This has got to be Congress 's top priority for recovery is getting people their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of your senate colleagues to sanction China . The White House has said that America should no longer invest in Chinese firms . Where do you think this is headed sort of when all this smoke settles ? <p> SEN . HAWLEY : Well , I think that Missourians ought to be able to sue China , those who have suffered damages from this terrible coronavirus . They ought to be able to go into court have their day in court and prove their case against China and if they win , they ought to be able to get damages . American courts ought to be able to freeze Chinese assets , government assets of this country and give those to people who win their cases . I just think that it is vital we stand up to Beijing and hold them accountable . They jailed doctors who tried to blow the whistle on this coronavirus in Wuhan . They tried to silence whistleblowers . They 're the ones who have caused this health crisis to turn into a global pandemic that has cost us tens of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , to say nothing of our allies around the world . So China needs to be on the hook here . And we need to give people the tools to hold them accountable . <p> PERREAULT : You talked this week about leaving the World Trade Organization , because of its relationship with China . Do you think we can break that supply chain in due time ? <p> SEN . HAWLEY : I think it 's absolutely vital that we work to move our supply chains back to this country , out critical ones that I 've introduced legislation to do that . That means jobs for people here in the state of Missouri , it means security for the United States . So this has got to be a top focus in years going forward is to get those supply chains and those jobs back . But when it comes to the World Trade Organization , why would we stay in an organization that 's failed ? Why would we stay with an organization that has enabled the rise of China . We 've got to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that protects our workers , that strengthens our nation and strengthens the free world because we have a long conflict with China coming . This is going to be a long struggle with them as they try to assert themselves as the dominant world power .

And so as part of that , we 're going to have to work with our partners and allies to get a better trade system , a better economic system ( and ) rebuild this country . <p> PERREAULT : Will you support the HEROES act ? Why or why not ? <p> SEN . HAWLEY : This is the Democrats ' plan . I 'm not going to support the democrats giveaway to lobbyists and to lawyers and to politicians .

If the meat is improperly cooked , the higher the risk of infection that may result from ingestion , " she said . <p> Lim said humans contracting a deadly disease may pass it on to others , potentially causing an epidemic if the disease is uncontrolled . <p> " If the zoonotic disease from wild animals starts jumping from human to human , or from domestic animals to humans , then that 's when an epidemic is likely to occur , " she warned . <h> Not pet or food <p> Lim said because of the sheer uncertainty of food safety , wild animals should be left alone in the wild as they are neither meant to be pets or food to be eaten , unlike animal livestock which undergo strict inspection to ensure the safety of the consuming public . <p> The National Meat Inspection Service ( NMIS ) , for instance , checks meats in animal farms and slaughterhouses to ensure that they are healthy , and hence , safe to eat . <p> Unfortunately , the NMIS covers only domestic or farmed animals , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even if they start inspecting wild-caught meat , certain wild animals , even if infected , may show atypical signs of known diseases or may not manifest signs at all , " she said . <p> " Specific laboratory examinations will have to be conducted , " added Lim . <h> Deadly , but ecologically important <p> Hence , Lim said eating bats , a practice in some areas in the Philippines , is very risky as bats have been known to be reservoirs for viruses that cause zoonotic diseases . <p> However , it does not mean that the bats should be exterminated , as their role in ensuring a balanced ecology outweighs the risk of transferring a deadly virus to humans , she hastened to add . <p> Glenn Maguad , OIC of the National Wildlife Research and Rescue Center ( NWRRC ) at the Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center ( NAPWC ) in Quezon City agrees . <p> He said there is also no way of knowing whether animals are in fact carriers of a deadly virus . <h> " Data deficient " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing the spread of a deadly virus is its lack of capacity , starting with being " data deficient " when it comes to viruses potentially emanating from animal wildlife . <p> According to Maguad , there 's no extensive study when it comes to health risks associated with eating exotic animals like bats , he said . <p> When it comes to a deadly virus , research and development are always reactive rather than proactive , Maguad said . <p> He explained that limited resources or funding is just one factor . <h> Like hitting a lotto jackpot <p> There 's a logical explanation to the limited research on the deadly virus from wild animal : governments doubt the wisdom of spending so much money to experiment on , say a couple of bats , not knowing what really to look for , in the first place . <p> Governments , Maguad said , would rather spend limited resources on studying food safety on livestock because of the economic impact of the import or export ban , like in the case of chicken for bird flu , cattle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , African swine fever virus . <p> Speaking mostly in Filipino , Maguad said there 's a very slim chance of discovering a potentially potent virus that can be passed on from animals to animals , animals to humans , and eventually , humans to humans , before a disease causes a mysterious death . <p> " It 's really like hitting jackpot , " he said . <p> According to Maguad , prevention is always better than cure when it comes to deadly diseases triggered by previously unknown virus which unique wildlife are known for . <h> Unique wildlife , unique virus <p> Maguad said the more exotic the animal , the more exotic the virus can be . <p> " As the saying goes , unique wildlife , unique virus , " he said . <p> Often , he said governments start investing in scientific research on animal wildlife after a mysterious or unexplained death that is threatening to cause a pandemic , such as what is now happening in the case of the Wuhan coronavirus . <p> " You would n't know what to look for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not until you 've been hit already , " said Maguad , citing the case of the dengue virus , which took several years for scientists to finally discover after many have perished . <p> " Being proactive in identifying the threats of a potentially deadly virus that can cause an epidemic is impossible .

China has already severely depleted its native turtle species , both on land and in the ocean within its 200 mile EEZ ( No China does not own the entire S.

This though is changing as individual states impose bans on the collection of these reptiles due in large part to the growing scarcity of them in specific regions of each state . These wet markets are unsanitary wells of virus laden meat and China should act on banning the capture , sale and consuming of all wild animals .

@@31644141 <h> Worker on board Diamond Princess says crew are at greater risk of coronavirus <p> A crew member aboard the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan said she fears the crew are at greater risk of being exposed to the outbreak because they are not being quarantined in the same way as the passengers and are having to continue working to take care of the guests . <p> More than 3,700 passengers and crew are stuck on the cruise ship in Yokohama that became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month . <p> The cruise ship has the largest outbreak of the virus outside of mainland China , with the number of infections continuing to increase day by day . On Wednesday , Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato announced 40 new cases among those on board . <p> To date , a total of 175 people aboard the Diamond Princess have become infected . But while those confirmed to have the virus have been sent to local hospitals , the remaining passengers and crew have been in quarantine on the ship since February 4 . <p> Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers who paid thousands of dollars for the cruise and are now confined to their rooms . The quarantine , which is scheduled to end on February 19 , has led to cabin fever among many -- with passengers only allowed out on deck for a limited time . <p> But as the quarantine continues more than 1,000 crew members remain at work , providing for and interacting with potentially infected passengers and taking care of the ship . They work wearing their uniforms , masks and gloves . <p> Japan 's Vice Minister of Health Gaku Hashimoto told CNN that , " We are trying to treat all the people equally . " <p> " We also know that crew members do n't have private rooms like the passengers have , and they still have to work and help on the ship , so it is not all equal . However , we are giving everyone on the ship guidelines for prevention , " Hashimoto added . <p> In a statement posted on their site , Princess Cruises said that , all crew members who have been cleared after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " fulfilling their duties as required " and additional crew testing by health officials is ongoing .

She is part of the security team on board the ship , working on the gangway as passengers are moved on and off . <p> Thakkar said she and her colleague -- who she shares a cabin with -- became ill with a headache , cough and a fever two days ago . Her supervisor told her to stop working and she is currently staying in her cabin in isolation . <p> " I 'm not eating very well and have been having fevers , " she told CNN in a Skype call Wednesday .

There are many places where we all are together , not separated from each other , " Thakkar said . " Especially when we sit in the same mess hall and eat together , the place where it can spread very fast . " <p> She worries that they do n't know who could be infected with the virus , especially as they continue to work around each other and the passengers . <p> " There are many more crew members who have been isolated to their cabins who are not even being tested yet , " she said . <p> Thakkar told CNN that her biggest concern is that the crew are not being separated from one another . She said " there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . " <p> " We just want every crew member to be tested and separated from the rest of the people who are infected .

The crew , she said , do n't mind working , but they just want assurance that they can work in a " safe environment " where they know they " wo n't be the next person to get infected . " <p> " We just want to feel safe . We do n't feel safe here with so many people , " she said . <p> On Wednesday , Japan 's Health Minister Kato said a " quarantine officer , " who came aboard the ship to help with the isolation had tested positive for the virus . <h> Questions over the quarantine method <p> Infectious disease experts have expressed skepticism that the current quarantine system is the best way to contain the virus . <p> Peter Hotez , Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Medicine , told CNN there are concerns that Japan and the cruise line are not handling the situation properly . <p> " We know that we 're taking infected patients off the ship and we know they 're infectious . So if you 've got the protective measures to take them off the ship safely , I do n't see why you would n't take the others off . " <p> Keeping everyone on board is potentially endangering the crew , said Eric Rubin , professor of immunology at Harvard University . " I think a lot of thought went into what to do with the passengers , but it puts the crew at increased risk . It 's a closed environment , a ship . It 's the perfect place for an infectious disease to spread , " said Rubin . <p> In a video statement on Wednesday , Princess Cruises Executive Vice President Rai Caluori said that " the quarantine protocols on board the Diamond Princess are completely under the control of the Japanese Ministry of Health . " <p> CNN has requested further comment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Princess Cruises . <p> According to Caluori the more than 1,000 crew currently working on board the ship will receive " normal pay and gratuities and paid time off following the quarantine .

" <p> He added that in abundance of caution the ship is " maximizing the percentage of fresh air in crew and guest cabins as well as public spaces . " <p> On Tuesday , ship Captain Stefano Ravera sought to reassure those on board about the ship 's air conditioning system . <p> In a public address to the ship , Ravera said , " I would like to assure you that we are indeed supplying 100% fresh air throughout the ship , including your staterooms .

India is still at the receiving end in terms of FII outflows . They continue to sell when global markets are looking better , things are stabilising , the virus spread has not been alarmingly high in India , the lockdown at least initially seems to be working , crude prices have got crushed . But foreign investors continue to throw in the towel , dump and sell and throw names like HDFC , HDFC Bank . Why is that ? Three simple reasons . To begin with , India was coming out of a weak growth backdrop and investors were worried how India 's fiscal and monetary policymakers will handle this new challenge and the policy announcement also took time to come through . Secondly , India 's selling has also been reflective of a broadbased passive selling ; probably it is not necessarily active selling , though we have seen that also . Passive selling does not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lastly , while India has had fewer cases , markets are also seeming to worry that the risk of a bigger spread in India still remains , because the testing infrastructure has not been ramped up well . So that worry is still lingering on the minds of investors . There is still risk out there , compared with other markets , where we have seen a lot of testing being done already . Investors can have some sense of when this is peaking out . These are the things we are hearing from investors . We may not agree with them but this is what we are hearing from investors . <p> How does one judge the market right now , because on one side you have got DII buying while on the other side you have got FII selling . I am talking about the near-term predictability of the market . Do you think one should not really bother about what is going to happen over the next three months or should one resign and accept the fact that India will be extremely vulnerable to FII flows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows will clearly matter . We have seen in the last couple of months that despite domestic buying , the market has corrected . Also , domestic investors might soon be running out of ammunition to keep buying as the market corrects or if the market corrects . So the dependence of the markets on foreign flows is much higher today than it was a month-and-a-half or two months back . The second thing is , we also like to draw parallels from say the GFC period , while FII selling in dollar terms was higher , in percentage terms , in market cap terms , it has been lower . If I look at DIIs , local mutual fund buying is better relatively now compared with that time , when it was much more sporadic . So this dynamic is also relevant in the context that India 's valuations despite the sharp correction have not reached GFC levels if we look at the trailing multiples , which are a fairer way of looking at the market right now . So keep that mind . <p> How do we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our earnings framework , multiples framework , our base case for Nifty is 10,000 for March , 2021 , and downside case is 6,000 and upside case 11,600 . So the risk-reward may appear attractive here at these levels , but the big presumption here is how coronavirus pans out in India and globally , and that is something which we must remember . <p> It is very difficult for any of us to model that in as we are not medical or healthcare experts . The big difference for this market cycle versus any of the past cycles is that what we have seen is not a classical market or economic cycle ; it is linked to what is happening around coronavirus . <p> Are you saying you are making a case that Nifty in a bear case scenario could slip to 6,000 level also ? Yes . Our downside case is 6,000 , our base case is 10,000 by March 2021 and our upside case is 11,600 . If you look at these three scenarios , the risk-reward from the current levels does appear attractive . But yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely ignore the downside scenario when you are taking investment calls . <p> In the near term , do you believe a lot more clarity will come next week once we know what is happening with the lockdown in India , whether the government chooses to extend it , whether it gets lifted ? Will that sort of arrest a lot of concerns at least in the near term in the market ? Absolutely , that will help . Even this week , we will get more clarity about the big concern as to where India is seeing local transmission versus community transmission . So even this week 's numbers will matter and obviously when the lockdown gets lifted and the actions taken after that will matter . <p> In the meantime , what is the strategy ? Do you try and make that core portfolio assuming Nifty goes to 6,000 ? I hope not . Or on the way down if do try and time the market , do you just go by those core portfolio names that you want to buy ? If they are already in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is always tough to time the market even in the best of times . In that context , today 's times are possibly the most uncertain times because it is not just market and economic cycle , it is also about what is happening around coronavirus . But we look at it beyond the valuation metric , even on trailing earnings basis , and look at balance sheets whether they can sustain any further deterioration or continue to deteriorate . What is also worth thinking about are the inherent businesses , how sustainable they are beyond the disruption from coronavirus in the sense that whatever destruction we are seeing today is it plain and simple postponement of demand and , therefore , whether the demand can come back fairly strongly ? Or if the business models are relevant or cases where it can hurt now or it will take much longer to come back . <p> So you look at multiple levels and screen for sectors and stocks . That is how we come up with various scenarios for investors . There will be pockets which have worked well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in our view , are offering attractive value today , especially the top end of the financial services sector , private banks with retail liability franchise , etc . Then there are a lot of deep value utility in oil and gas stocks , where we do not see any risk to inherent business models and they are attractive at these level . Then , telecom is an obvious one . And then it becomes much more stock specific rather than big picture-specific calls . <p> While a breakthrough on the medical front of course could potentially lead the recovery , do you think we could see some amount of economic and business normalisation by Q3 or is it still a very long way off given the talks about the kind of ballooning recession that we could witness ? It all depends on how prolonged the disruption is , and how much damage the disruption causes to jobs . Because the more jobs are lost in the interim , the slower the recovery period will be . It takes time for businesses to hire and ramp up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical impact , but also psychologically , because it takes time for businesses to come back . The simple answer is if the lockdown lifts in a couple of weeks from now , and things start normalizing in terms of coronavirus data points , then yes Q3 will definitely have a good recovery . If the lockdown is not lifted completely but there is some mix and match here and there or the impact of coronavirus in terms of cases , deaths is prolonged , then it will be a much more gradual recovery . So , the pace and scale of disruption will matter in terms of pace and scale of recovery . <p> We have seen some economic relief measures from RBI , but naturally in trouble times such as this , corporate India as well as all of market participants are in need of more measures . Do you think that a huge fiscal stimulus is the need of the hour on top of the recently-announced measures by the RBI ? What more do you think needs to be done ? Absolutely . If you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP fiscal stimulus . And today as we speak , even if you combine the stimulus announced by the states , it is roughly 1 per cent or 1.1 per cent of GDP . Obviously as the fiscal space is much smaller today compared with what it was in 2008 , that could put things in perspective beyond what other global markets or economies are doing . <p> Clearly given the disruption , yes there is scope and expectation among investors that there will be more fiscal stimulus coming . There have been reports about what further relaxations or the government will do for SMEs . So it is quite likely that more fiscal stimulus will come . Whether they will replicate the GFC is anyone 's guess . It all depends on the scale and timing of the entire disruption . If this continues for three more months , then obviously we are looking for much bigger fiscal stimulus . If post lockdown things normalise , then we will have possibly one more round but not necessarily similar to the 2008 levels .

@@71916541 <p> The COVID-19 pandemic is a complex global crisis without contemporary precedent . In just about every country around the world , the pandemic response is taking up the bulk of resources , expertise , time and effort . <p> But , how would people and systems cope if a major natural hazard , like an earthquake or a tropical cyclone , occurs while the COVID-19 pandemic continues ? <p> How would people and systems cope if a major natural hazard occurs during COVID-19 ? Picture : Getty Images <p> Our new research combines simple epidemiological models with natural hazard curves to investigate potential scenarios that could eventuate in several different countries , if there were to be a natural disaster . <p> Importantly , it also outlines several strategic steps that governments and disaster management agencies might consider to minimise risks during the pandemic . <h> From bushfires to pandemics <p> In January this year , as devastating bushfires drove thousands of Australians to evacuate their homes , China imposed a lockdown in Hubei province to mitigate the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease we now know as COVID-19 . <p> By the end of the month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged as a global pandemic that by late April , had caused more than 233,000 deaths around the world . <p> A government and agency response to a crisis -- whether it 's bushfires or a pandemic -- is informed by expert knowledge , data , experience and advice about societal exposure and vulnerability to the hazard . <p> In late March , a magnitude 5.3 earthquake hit Zagreb , the capital of Croatia , disrupting newly-introduced lockdown measures . While the full effect of this temporary disruption on COVID-19 infections is yet to be understood in detail , according to our analysis of the data available , there was an apparent increase in the rate of infections in the days following the earthquake . <p> So you have on one hand , according to the initial media and operational reports , the fact that COVID-19 counter measures can hamper the emergency response to disasters like these . Then on the other hand , the disruption to social distancing that can increase the potential for infection . <p> Natural disasters can displace large numbers of people and epidemic diseases often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential double whammy that governments may have to deal with in the next few months -- maybe years . And preparation is key . <p> To understand the potential impact of a pandemic-natural disaster hybrid scenario , we combined epidemic projection models with natural hazard models to come up with two preliminary examples . <h> Hybrid forecasting to project fatalities <p> Our team used a publicly available epidemic forecasting platform to look at how the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses can influence projections of the infection rate and fatalities in United States , Australia , Bangladesh and China . <p> These projections are worked out by minimising the difference between the number of confirmed fatalities and those predicted by an epidemic model for a given period of time , which takes into account factors such as how contagious COVID-19 is ( the reproduction number : R0 ) and how effective counter COVID-19 measures are ( quantified as percentages ) . <p> Figure 3 : The research looked at the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses on the infection rate and fatalities in United States , Australia , Bangladesh and China . Graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States ( on panel A ) could rise from around 92,000 ( the dashed grey line ) to 220,000 ( the solid grey line ) if the counter measures are relaxed by only 10 per cent . <p> To give this some context , we also looked at the seasonal hazard curves alongside COVID-19 projection curves . Seasonal natural hazards -- like floods , hurricanes and tropical cyclones , heat waves , wildfires and tornadoes -- have the potential to exacerbate the impact of COVID-19 . <p> The overall probability of these natural hazards occurring in the United States , Bangladesh and China actually increases over the next few months , while here in Australia , their probability diminishes over the same period . <p> So , during the Northern hemisphere 's summer , countries like the US , Bangladesh , and China are particularly exposed to compound risks of the pandemic and natural disasters . <h> The timing of natural hazards <p> Using a simple epidemic model , we investigated the impact of the timing of a potential natural disaster on the daily new infection rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to " flatten " in order to manage the demand on health care services . Early analysis shows that these interventions have substantially curtailed the demand on health services to date . <p> Figure 4 , : The blue curve illustrates a background daily infection rate before any intervention , the red curve is the infection rate with flattening measures . Graphic : Supplied <p> In the Figure 4 , the blue curve illustrates a typical background daily infection rate before any intervention and the red curve is the infection rate with flattening measures in full force . <p> We then introduced an external event , like a natural disaster , to the flattened curve . <p> Our team introduced this event on either side of the infection rate peak ( before the peak in the left column and after peak in the right ) . We also assume a COVID-19 incubation period of five days and that flattening measures can be fully re-enforced after a specified number of days ( days , 7 and 21 used here ) following the hazard . <p> The infection rate curve with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which shows an increase in infection rate above the flattened curve to varying degrees . <p> This experiment provides two important insights . <p> The first is that the increase in infection rate is greater for events occurring in the pre-peak period than the post-peak period . The second is that the infection rate increases with the time it takes to fully re-introduce social distancing measures . <p> While these two modelling examples have uncertainties , they emphasise the multidimensional nature of decisions that have to be made for COVID-19 counter measures to be effective during natural disasters . <p> There was an apparent increase in the rate of infections in the days following the earthquake in Zagreb . Picture : Getty Images <h> COVID-19 strategies <p> In the absence of a vaccine , projections of COVID-19 transmission indicate that the current crisis will be a protracted one . <p> But there are four pre-emptive strategies that governments can adopt to counter the compound risks of COVID-19 and natural hazards . <p> Thirdly , a re-design of policy responses is needed to address different natural hazards with a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of post-disaster activities , ranging from emergency aid distribution to providing shelter . <p> Finally , supporting relief agencies serving lower income communities or regions and their governments is important as impacts of compound effects on these areas are likely to be disproportionately high . <p> While the primary focus of many governments is on managing the COVID-19 crisis , planning for potentially concurrent natural disasters is also crucial to ensure communities are adequately prepared for the complexities that could arise from overlapping crises . <h> Privacy Statement <p> The University of Melbourne ( University ) collects , uses , handles and discloses personal information in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 ( Vic ) ( Act ) and other applicable legislation . <p> This Privacy Statement relates only to the collection of personal information in relation to the Pursuit Website .

The world is in danger of falling into a Great Depression , with millions of workers being rendered unemployed across the globe . The impact will especially hit the poor -- both in terms of health and economics ; many can not even afford to wash their hands because of the lack of water . What will happen to the millions who can not practice social distancing ? The slum-dwellers , the prison population and the refugees huddled in tents ? <p> Businesses are closing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing , and vigorously wash their hands . People are stocking up on all kinds of food and sundries that are part of daily living . Some are hoarding masks , toilet paper and other necessities , should COVID-19 linger on for weeks , months , or years . <p> While the US has just passed a 2 trillion dollar aid package , the details seem to once again point to socialism for Wall Street , in the form of bailouts , a small pay-cheque for the working poor , and little else for Main Street . Income inequality is poised to increase yet further . <p> I predict that this period of deprivation and anxiety will usher in new consumer attitudes and behaviours that will change the nature of today 's capitalism . Finally , citizens will re-examine what they consume , how much they consume , and how all this is influenced by class issues and inequality . Citizens need to re-examine our capitalist assumptions and emerge from this terrible period with a new , more equitable form of capitalism . <p> Capitalism 's Dependence on Endless Consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the emergence of the Industrial Revolution . <p> The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century greatly increased the number of goods and services available to the world 's population . The steam engine , railroads , new machinery and factories , and improved agriculture greatly increased the economy 's productive capacity . More production inevitably leads to more consumption , which in turn leads to more investment . More investment increases production in an ever expanding world of goods . <p> Citizens delighted in the availability of more goods and choices . They could individualize their personalities through their choices of food , clothing and shelter . They could shop endlessly and marvel at the innovative offerings of the producers . <p> Citizens increasingly turned into consumers . Consuming became a lifestyle and culture . Producers profited greatly from the increasing number of active consumers . Producers were eager to stimulate more demand and more consumption . They turned to print advertising and sales calls , and as new media arose , they turned to telemarketing , radio marketing , TV marketing , and Internet marketing . Business firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer desire and purchasing . <p> From the beginning , some onlookers had misgivings about the rise of consumerism . Many religious leaders saw the growing interest of citizens in material goods as competing with religious attention and spiritual values . The legacy of puritanical values kept certain population groups from acquiring too many goods and getting into too much debt . Some citizens were particularly critical of wealthy consumers who used goods to flaunt their wealth . The economist Thorsten Veblen was the first to write about " conspicuous consumption " that he saw as a malady taking people away from more meditative lifestyles . In The Theory of the Leisure Class , Veblen exposed this sickness of status display . Had he lived long enough , he would have been aghast at the news that the former first lady of the Philippines , Imelda Marcos , owned 3,000 pairs of shoes that languished in storage since her exile from the Philippines . <p> The Growing Number of Anti-consumerists <p> There are signs today of a growing anti-consuming movement . We can distinguish at least five types of anti-consumerists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life simplifiers , persons who want to eat less and buy less . They are reacting to the clutter of ' stuff ' . They want to downsize their possessions , many of which lie around unused and unnecessary . Some life-simplifiers are less interested in owning goods such as cars or even homes ; they prefer renting to buying and owning . <p> The second group consists of de-growth activists who feel that too much time and effort are going into consuming . This feeling is captured in William Wordsworth 's poem , <p> " The world is too much with us ... <p> Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers : <p> Little we see in Nature that is ours ; <p> We have given our hearts away , a sordid boon ! " <p> De-growth activists worry that consumption will outpace the carrying capacity of the Earth . In 1970 , the world population was 3.7 billion . By 2011 , the world population grew to 7.0 billion . Today ( 2020 ) , the world population stands at 7.7 billion . The U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2050 . The nightmare would be that the Earth can not feed so many people . The amount of arable land is limited and the top soil is getting poorer . Several parts of our oceans are dead zones with no living marine life . De-growth activists call for conservation and reducing our material needs . They worry about the people in the emerging poor nations aspiring to achieve the same standard of living found in advanced countries , something that is not possible . They see greedy producers doing their best to create ' false and unsustainable needs . ' <p> The third group consists of climate activists who worry about the harm and risk that high buying consumers are doing to our planet through generating so much carbon footprints that pollute our air and water . Climate activists carry a strong respect for nature and science and have genuine concerns about the future of our planet . <p> Fourth , there are sane food choosers who have turned into vegetarians and vegans . They are upset with how we kill animals to get our food . Everyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit diet . Livestock managers fatten up their cows and chickens to grow fast , and then kill them to sell animal parts in the pursuit of profits . Meanwhile , cows are a major emitter of methane that heats our earth and leads to higher temperatures , faster glacial melting , and flooding of cities . To produce one kilogram of beef , requires between 15,000 and 20,000 liters of water as well as so much roughage to feed the animals . <p> Fifth , we hear about conservation activists who plead not to destroy existing goods but to reuse , repair , redecorate them or give them to needy people . Conservationists want companies to develop better and fewer goods that last longer . They criticize a company such as Zara that produces a new set of women 's clothing styles every two weeks that would only be available only for two weeks . Conservationists oppose any acts of planned obsolescence . They are hostile to the luxury goods industry . Many are environmentalists and anti-globalists . <p> The anti-consumerism movement has produced a growing literature . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , This Changes Everything , and The Shock Doctrine . Also see the documentary film The Corporation by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott . <p> How Businesses Sustain the Consumer Sentiment <p> Business firms have an intrinsic interest in endlessly expanding consumption for the purpose of higher profits . They rely on three disciplines to boost consumption and brand preference . The first is innovation to produce attractive new products and brands to enchant customer interest and purchase . The second is marketing that supplies the tools to reach consumers and motivate and facilitate their purchasing . The third discipline is credit to enable people to buy more than they could normally buy on their low incomes . Businesses aim to make consumption our way of life . To keep their productive equipment and factories going , they must ritualize some consumer behaviour . Holidays like Halloween , Christmas , Easter , Mother 's Day , and Father 's Day are partly promoted to stimulate more purchasing . Businesses want not only purchase of their goods but fast consumption so that objects burn up , wear out , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a hyper-real world of must-have products that claim to deliver happiness and well-being . Businesses refashion commodities into compelling brands that can bring meaning into the consumer 's life . One 's brand choices send a signal of who the person is and what he or she values . Brands bring strangers together to share carefully designed images and meanings . <p> How Will Anti-consumerism Change Capitalism <p> Capitalism is an economic system devoted to continuous and unending growth . It makes two assumptions : ( 1 ) people have an unlimited appetite for more and more goods and ( 2 ) the Earth has unlimited resources to support unlimited growth . Both of these are now questioned . First , many people become jaded and satiated by the effort to continuously consume more goods . Second , the earth 's resources are finite , not infinite , and could not meet the needs of a growing world population that comes with growing material needs . <p> Until now , most countries have used only one measure to assess the performance of their economy . That measure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total value of the goods and services produced in a given year by the country 's economy . What it does n't measure is whether GDP growth has been accompanied by a growth in people 's well-being or happiness . <p> We can imagine a case where GDP grows by 2 or 3 percent by workers working very hard and even at overtime . They only have two weeks of vacation a year . They have little time for leisure or renewal . They might be stressed by unexpected medical bills that hit their savings . They might be unable to send their children to college , leaving their children with lower skills and lower earning potential . Those students who manage to go to college graduate with huge debt . Graduates are carrying a college debt of $1.2 trillion . They can not buy furniture or a home , or even afford to get married . In such a case , we would guess that GDP went up but the nation 's average well-being and happiness went down . <p> We badly need to add new measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing an annual measure of gross domestic happiness ( GDH ) or gross domestic well-being ( GDW ) . We know that citizens in Scandinavian countries enjoy a substantially higher level of happiness and well-being than American citizens and run good economies . Is our addiction to consuming , consuming us ? <p> Part of the problem of economic growth is that the fruits of gains in productivity are not shared equitably . This is obvious in a country with a growing number of billionaires and a great number of poor workers . Many CEOs are paid 300 times what their average worker earns , and some take home as much as 1100 times the average worker . The economic system is rigged . Corporations have succeeded in emasculating trade unions and leaving workers with no say in what they or their bosses should be paid . <p> Even some billionaires are unhappy with this greatly lopsided pay arrangement . Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have publicly called for raising the top income tax rate . This top rate is now down to 37% as a result of the 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70% and manage to run a good economy , one with free health care and free college education . One citizen billionaire , Nick Hanauer has spoken about this on TED . He warns his fellow billionaires that " the pitchforks are coming . " He pleads with them to pay higher wages and taxes and share more of the productivity gains with the working class . The working class should earn enough to eat well , pay rent , and retire with adequate savings . Today there are too many workers who could n't muster $400 to pay for a pressing payment they must make . <p> Capitalism Faces the COVID-19 Crisis <p> Capitalism will change for other reasons as well . If more consumers decide to be anti-consumerists , they will spend less . Their spending has traditionally supported 70% of our economy . If this goes down , our economy contracts in size . A slowdown in economic growth will lead to more unemployment . Add the fact that more jobs are being lost to artificial intelligence ( AI ) and robots . This will require capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food stamps , food kitchens , and social assistance . <p> Capitalism will have to print more money . We see this happening with the $2 trillion outlay voted by Congress to help support desperate workers in the face of the COVID-19 crisis . And $2 trillion is only to tide over the situation in the short run . More trillions will have to be spent . This means huge deficits that ca n't be covered by existing tax revenues . To the extent possible , tax rates will have to be dramatically increased . The lives of the rich are normally not affected by the grief and hardship of the poor . But now it is time for the rich to pay more and share more . In our current crisis , CEOs and their highly paid staffs have to take a cut in their pay . Boeing 's executives recently set an example by saying they will work with no pay during the coming crisis . <p> When the COVID-19 crisis is over , capitalism will have moved to a new stage . Consumers will be more thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume . Here are possible developments : <p> 1 . Some weaker companies and brands will vanish . Consumers will have to find reliable and satisfying replacement brands . <p> 2 . The Coronavirus makes us aware of how fragile our health is . We can catch colds easily in crowds . We must stop shaking hands when we meet and greet . We need to eat more healthy foods to have a greater resistance to germs and flus . <p> 3 . We are shocked by the inadequacy of our health system and its great cost . We need to stay out of the hospital and play safe . <p> 4 . The sudden loss of jobs will remain a trauma even after workers get jobs back . They will spend and save their money more carefully . <p> 5 . Staying home led many consumers to become producers of their own food needs . More home cooking , more gardening to grow vegetables and herbs . Less eating out . <p> 6 . We place more value on the needs of our family , friends and community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to choose good and healthy foods and buy more sensible clothing and other goods . <p> 7 . We will want brands to spell out their greater purpose and how each is serving the common good . <p> 8 . People will become more conscious of the fragility of the planet , of air and water pollution , of water shortages , and other problems . <p> More people will seek to achieve a better balance between work , family and leisure . Many will move from an addiction to materialism to sensing other paths to a good life . They will move to post-consumerism . <p> Capitalism remains the best engine for efficient economic growth . It also can be the best engine for equitable economic growth . It does n't change to socialism when we raise taxes on the rich . We have given up on the false economic doctrine that the poor win when the rich get richer . Actually , the rich will get richer mainly by leaving more money in the hands of working class families to spend . <p> As the coronavirus crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best interest of all -- rich and poor alike . It is time to rethink and rewire capitalism and transform it into a more equitable form -- based on democracy and social justice .

@@84425441 <p> SPRINGFIELD -- As the number of cases of COVID-19 rises around the world , Baystate Health says it is well prepared and working with other Western Massachusetts health care providers to respond to the pandemic . <p> Baystate has prepared a two-bed special pathogens unit and a 12-bed isolation unit for immediate response and is working with other hospitals to ensure there is capacity to handle additional patients as cases are confirmed and require hospital treatment , said Dr. Mark A. Keroack , president and CEO of Baystate Health . <p> Keroack , who revealed there are now 24 Baystate patients suspected of having the virus , met with The Republican editorial board on Friday to outline the local response to the respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that emerged out of China at the end of December . Gov . Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Wednesday , followed by a ban on public gatherings of more than 250 people on Friday . The governor yesterday established a special response commission . <p> While there are as of yet no confirmed or presumptive cases in Hampden County , at least 50 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,100 confirmed cases . The worldwide total is nearing 150,000 on Saturday with more than 5,500 deaths . <p> Keroack says Baystate and the region 's other hospitals anticipate seeing a growing number of patients diagnosed with the virus in the coming weeks . <p> " It is now clear that somebody who is infected with this coronavirus can carry a large amount of this virus in their nose and mouth well before they feel very sick . Because infectious individuals are so hard to detect and because the entire population is naive , that is , not immune to this new virus we expect that we will soon be dealing with a large number of patients with either suspect or confirmed infections , " he said . " Therefore , it is important for all of us to stay informed about how we protect ourselves and to remain effective in our jobs so we can help our communities minimize the threat . " <p> In outlining the steps Baystate has taken over the past several weeks , Keroack detailed that a 12-bed isolation unit in a formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Springfield Hospital within Baystate Medical Center has been prepared for the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 . It will be used for cases that do not require intensive care but need hospital level care . <p> Baystate has also established two-bed special pathogens unit now converted to a respiratory transmission ready , intensive care unit . <p> " In addition to those 14 rooms , we have 80 other rooms with negative pressure ( to control air flow ) that can be converted to rooms where you can safely care for a coronavirus patient , " said Keroack of capacity for treatment at Baystate Medical in addition to respiratory isolation rooms available at other Baystate hospitals . <p> Coronavirus will likely be a mild illness in most people , like a cold , Keroack noted , but he added that it can cause severe complications in the elderly and frail and require hospitalization or even critical care treatment . <p> " The incident command team is considering new information on a daily basis , " he said . " This issue is very fast moving , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with issues the employees bring forward from the front lines , and we are trying to anticipate the course of the epidemic here in Western Massachusetts . " <p> The public must be an active partner in efforts to fight the spread of the virus , Keroack stressed . Following health care protocols for hygiene and social distancing are of critical importance , he said , urging the public to help hospitals respond effectively and keep their workforce healthy . <p> " We are trying to reach this balance between reassurance -- ' Everything is fine , everything is OK , ' which we ca n't say , versus the panic of run out and fill your closets with toilet paper or whatever , " Keroack said . <p> " We would like people to be concerned and basically be informed and to be prudent in terms of taking precautions to avoid exposure , but it is not like they have to lock themselves in their closets for three weeks . " <p> A shortage of test kits provided by the federal Food and Drug Administration to the state Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , Keroack said . He said Baystate is awaiting the results on about 30 test samples . <p> " This virus is here . It is in our community now -- we strongly suspect that it is -- and people need to start taking seriously all the advice on protection , " he said . <p> Good hygiene , calling one 's primary physician if experiencing related symptoms and engaging in activities that avoid close contact can all reduce the spread of the virus while allowing for some normal routine at a time when many social and other activities have been temporarily canceled , Keroack said . <p> " Hand washing , avoiding direct person contact and large crowds are at the center of how to protect yourself because we do n't yet have a vaccine or treatment for this infection , " said Keroack . " We are trying to get people to reach out by telehealth or phone first before coming in physically ( through emergency ) so that they can be screened on whether they need to come in or not . This is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our employees . " <p> He added , " The great majority of people with respiratory symptoms are OK to stay home , but a small percentage do need to come in and get seen . " <p> He said people are screened for the disease by Baystate Health , including through an app that offers access to a real-time telemedicine video visit with a Baystate primary care provider , with such questions as " Do you have a temperature over a certain amount ? " and " Are you able to speak a full sentence without losing any breaths ? " <p> Keroack 's background is in infectious disease as is that of Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein who heads Baystate 's command center for COVID-19 and who was also in attendance at the meeting with the editorial board . <p> Both stress the urgency for hospitals to have what they need to test for SARS-CoV-2 in patients their health care providers diagnosis with suspect symptoms . <p> " There has been a shortage for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to produce the test kits , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced shortages and they are having to ration them to people who are most severely ill , " said Keroack . <p> " That means when we call up to get a patient tested through the DPH we are told the patient does not fit the criteria because of the shortage . We will then send the test to a commercial lab , we use LabCorp , but the turnaround is three to four days , " he explained . " We are told it might be several weeks before we have the reagents we need at Baystate to test which would typically be a four-hour turnaround . We assay for 20 different respiratory viruses using the same equipment they do at DPH but we do n't have what we need for this virus . " <p> Artenstein said for a hospital not to be able to test within its system for the virus and get the results within hours rather than days or much longer " makes clinical decision making difficult because a lot of it is based on available information so it adds uncertainty . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Artenstein when asked whether Baystate would consider drive-through testing where a patient , with a doctor 's note and photo identification , is swabbed for a nasal specimen without having to get out of their car by health care workers in protective gear . <p> The Trump administration , in announcing Friday it would allow pharmaceutical giant Roche to sell its three-hour coronavirus test to U.S. labs , said access to such testing models as drive-through would be expanded through a Google-designed web page , but Google said it is not building such a nationwide website . <p> " We have various models ready to go , we just do n't have the kits or the availability , " said Arenstein of what it might do if it had the ability to do its own testing for SARS-CoV-2 . <p> He added the COVID-19 has " no clear cut clinical presentation that is very consistent with just one thing . " <p> " It appears with this infection the vast majority of cases are relatively mild , although we do n't know as much about it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know the denominator of patients , " Artenstein said . <p> " What we know now is the sick hospital level of patients in the United States . We may know them and test their status but they are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of level of infection in the community . " <p> Different estimates within the CDC have predicted up to half the U.S. population could eventually become infected with SARS-CoV-2 , with more than 2 million requiring hospitalization . <p> The impact of the epidemic has raised concerns around availability of hospital beds , staffing and equipment supplies , especially for those with severe complications from COVID-19 that can cause an atypical form of pneumonia and lead to organ failure . <p> " I think we are in a pretty good place locally at Baystate Health , " Arenstein said . " We feel like we are in a decent place to respond and roll with the punches for what is undoubtedly going to be a somewhat prolonged event here . This is different from a hurricane or a natural disaster where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be devastating but it is usually time limited . This could be a little bit different and we can not necessarily predict what the curve ( of impact ) will look like on this . " <p> Artenstein , too , stressed the " public has a role and responsibilities in this . " <p> " Part of the flattening of the curve , " Artenstein said , " is you still have to do the right things , and all our federal authorities -- the CDC , the National Institutes of Health , the DPH -- regionally offer good advice around the social distancing discussions they are having , the individual things you can do at little cost , a temporary inconvenience and clearly not the way we want to go about our lives as Americans , but for the short term it is the way we should in order to minimize the impact and the chance of more widespread disease . " <p> He also stressed " the majority of cases , even if they come in and get some kind of treatment and get diagnosed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue their recovery at home and be fine . " <p> He said cases with severe complications " would add a new wrinkle in terms of transmissibility " of COVID-2019 , but that Baystate is " perfectly suited to treat them as a " tertiary and quaternary care medical center that takes care of non-epidemic conditions of very , very sick patients with lots of medical needs .

@@85021541 <h> Financing and debt management for emerging market economies <p> Two of the major issues in the economic management of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis are how to guarantee financing for emerging and developing countries , and how to manage their outstanding debts . The magnitude of the challenge is immense : Both the IMF Managing Director and UNCTAD have argued that the world needs $2.5 trillion of financing for these countries . <h> Chair - U.N . Committee for Development Policy <h> Professor and Director , Economic and Political Development Concentration , School for International and Public Affairs - Columbia University <p> Financing should come from multiple sources . Official financing from multilateral development banks and the IMF is , of course , crucial , as it was during the 2008-09 financial crisis . Official development assistance also plays a fundamental role in poor countries . In relation to debt , there has already been some action on official debts of low-income countries and calls for broader debt standstills . But a crucial issue for emerging economies is private sector financing and debt restructuring . <p> As the COVID-19 crisis unfolded , the world experienced again a " sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries was interrupted . During the early phase of the crisis , the IMF estimates that over $100 billion of private portfolio capital left emerging economies , a much larger outflow than after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . <p> But there has also been a recent revival of private financing that has been broadly ignored . The weekly analysis by JPMorgan of capital flows to emerging markets ( including investment in local bond markets ) indicates that there was a net outflow of $66.1 billion in March . But the net outflows have been smaller since then -- $11.3 billion in April and $9.6 billion during the first three weeks of May -- and have concentrated in equity flows . In fact , there have net inflows in May into hard-currency bonds . <p> Indeed , several emerging countries have been able to issue bonds in international markets in recent weeks on fairly good conditions . Focusing on Latin America , this includes Chile , Guatemala , Mexico , Paraguay , Peru , and Panama . Two regional banks have also done so ( the Central American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , CAF ) , as well as two state-owned firms from Chile ( Codelco and the Santiago Metro ) and two from Colombia ( Ecopetrol and the Bogota Electric Energy Company , both with some private shareholders ) . <p> From mid-April to mid-May 2020 , the total of these bond issues amounted to over $17 billion , much more than multilateral financing to Latin America during this period . Some of the issues achieved relatively good interest rates . The Mexican bond issue of April 22 , for a total of $6 billion , was the largest in its history , was oversubscribed 4.75 times , and got an effective interest rate of 5 percent for its 2031 bond . The 2031 Chilean bond issue of May 5 got an even lower rate of around 2.5 percent . <p> This is consistent with the trends in the risk margins and the yield of emerging market bonds . It is true that emerging markets ' bond spreads remain above pre-crisis levels , but the strong reduction in U.S. Treasury bond yields on which those spreads are added indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling . Measured by the best-known indicator of those yields , JPMorgan 's EMBI , the peak yield during the current crisis was 6.6 percent and has been falling to less than to 6 percent ( Figure 1 ) . As a reference , this is below the levels reached during the emerging markets ' turmoil of 2018 and much below the peak reached after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ( when it peaked at 12 percent ) and , particularly , after the Russian debt moratoria of August 1998 ( when it peaked at 17 percent ) . <p> Together with trends in bond yields , this means that some form of " search for yield " seems to have returned . Furthermore , emerging markets have been able to issue bonds only two months after the financial collapse in February , a much shorter period than the 12 months that it took to do so after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , and several years after the Russian 1998 debt moratoria . <p> This has major implications for the management of emerging countries ' debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris Club to decree a debt standstill for the poorest countries through 2020 , some analysts have argued in favor of a similar standstill for emerging economies . <p> However , debt conditions and market access are so markedly different among emerging economies that no unique way forward is desirable . In fact , there are three entirely different cases . Focusing again on Latin America , the first is that of countries that require major debt restructurings to guarantee sustainable debt levels ( e.g. , Argentina and Ecuador ) . The second case is countries that are already benefiting from accessing international capital markets . They can combine external private financing with borrowing from multilateral development banks and local bond financing . <p> A third group is countries in between these two extremes who need a voluntary debt standstill ( supervised by the World Bank or regional development banks ) , such as that proposed by Patrick Bolton , Lee Buchheit , and others . According to this proposal , debt amortizations would be postponed and interest payments would be made into a central credit facility that would re-lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemics . <p> It should be added that the implementation of this proposal should go hand-in-hand with two other multilateral policies , which have been surprisingly absent from the international agenda during the current crisis . <p> The first is to negotiate a formal institutional mechanism to manage the restructuring of sovereign debts , beyond the market-based mechanism that was agreed in 2015 . <p> The second is a major capitalization of multilateral development banks , similar to the one that took place in 2009-10 and that was essential for these banks to significantly increase lending to emerging and developing countries at the time . An agreement to capitalize the World Bank was reached in 2018 and has allowed it to launch a $160 billion 15-month program . However , regional development banks also need major capitalizations . This is particularly true of the Inter-American Development Bank and the Development Bank of Latin America , the two major multilateral banks serving Latin America . <p> The way forward should , therefore , be a mix of heterogeneous debt solutions and a major increase of financing from multilateral development banks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return to bond issues in international financial markets . <p> This blog was first launched in September 2013 by the World Bank and the Brookings Institution in an effort to hold governments more accountable to poor people and offer solutions to the most prominent development challenges .

" <p> At the beginning of March , the plan was still for a wedding at the end of May with about 40 guests , then a trip to Hall 's native United Kingdom so Clutter could meet his family . <p> Things changed quickly . <p> Hall , an employee of Eli Lilly , was instructed to work from home in early March .

Because even if we could have it there are going to be people who ca n't come or would be afraid to come , " she said . <p> Clutter said the couple managed to keep a level head despite their best-laid plans falling to pieces . She credits their maturity , pointing out that she is in her late 50s and Hall is in his early 60s . <p> But she is also thankful to the local vendors and wedding professionals she is working with for being flexible doing everything they can to meet their needs . <p> " Our lives are changing , " Clutter said , " so you may end up kind of wanting a completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But a marriage means more than a party . It 's also a legal status that can have important implications on all aspects of life -- including health insurance . <h> Getting a marriage license <p> When Clutter was laid off , it created another problem : she would n't have health insurance after the end of the month . Once they were wed , she could be added to Hall 's insurance , but the closure of government offices statewide made it initially unclear when they would be able to obtain a marriage license . <p> Dan Henkel , the professional wedding officiant Clutter and Hall have been working with , said couples can still get married during the statewide stay-at-home order . In Marion County , marriage licenses can be obtained on Friday 's after making an appointment with the county clerk 's office . <h> COVID-19 : Resources <p> The Indiana State Department of Health hotline is 317-233-7125 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and 317-233-1325 afterward . <p> Officials at the Hamilton County Clerk 's Office told IndyStar that getting a marriage license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment and complete a portion of the application online to get their license there . <p> Licenses are good for 60 days , meaning they can be used immediately , or held onto should a couple choose to wait out the pandemic and officially get married at a later date . <p> Clutter and Hall are working with the Marion County Clerk 's Office to determine when they can obtain their license <h> The wedding industry <p> " Even in normal times , planning a wedding is an extraordinary challenge . Most people have never planned an event of that scale , of that cost or that important to them , " he said . <p> The most common alternative is getting married on paper now and celebrating later . But Henkel added that in the age of livestreaming , something like a digital ceremony where guests " login to attend " is also an option . <p> " I have been so moved by the artists who are streaming and choral groups who will put a song together with everyone recording their parts at home , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to affirm your commitment while we 're confined to our homes . " <p> Jean Rivers , owner of Blue Llama Events , said there are a few things couples can do to make the reality of a postponed or canceled wedding less painful . <p> The most important is cancellation insurance which can be crucial for both weddings and corporate events slated for this spring or summer . While it may be too late to add that protection post-booking in many cases , Rivers said it is situational and you should contact your insurance provider to see what your options are . <p> She also urges couples to closely look at any the contracts for any vendors they 've secured so they can go into the conversation of adjusting dates with confidence . <h> Rescheduling <p> When it comes to dates , River said the year itself may make things a bit trickier . <p> " Because 2020 is one of the most popular wedding years I have ever seen , dates are minimal . And you want to go far enough out because you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You do n't want to schedule something out to June because we do n't even know if it 's going to be over by that time . " <p> Another tip Rivers offers is selecting a Friday or Sunday as your new wedding date if given the opportunity . <p> " These are non-prime wedding days , so there is a huge likelihood all of your vendors will be available and nobody will charge any additional fees to rebook to those dates , " she said . <p> And remember : just because a mandate is lifted does n't mean your guests will be ready to party . <p> " For example we have a very large corporate event in mid-May , " Rivers said . " Yes , you may be able to have that . But the perception of bringing 1000 people together in mid-May might be reason enough to cancel or postpone . " <p> Jennifer Hanshew , a general manager with Circle City Expos , said it 's also not too late to bring on a wedding planner . With that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide couples someone who knows what small details might be overlooked if you begin to panic . <p> Hanshew said in her role , she also has the unique task of working with both couples , and wedding industry professionals . While the COVID-19 outbreak creates uncertainty for brides and grooms , it does the same for photographers , DJs , venue owners and others who are having their livelihoods put on hold . <p> Hanshew said the prospect of changing dates can be intimidating , but coming to an agreement is mutually beneficial for both client and vendor . <p> What is encouraging , she said , is what she calls countless examples of " community over competition " in the local wedding industry . <p> She gives an example of photographers who may be unavailable during a couple 's new wedding date referring that couple to another photographer who they know to be of a similar skill level , style and price point . <p> " I 've lived in Indiana for 20 years , I 've been in this industry 18 of those years ... and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together , " she said . " Each small business owner is concerned about themselves , but they 're also concerned about their fellow photographer , their fellow venue , their fellow DJ or entertainer or emcee business . We all work so hard together in this community . <p> " Right now this is crushing because we 're in the middle of it , but there 's light at the end of the tunnel .

In other words , the normal human rights that we expect at times when there 's no such health emergency should be restricted if that 's necessary to deal with an emergency . <p> In his opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the anti-coronavirus measures introduced in the UK , especially if they were required by the best scientific advice , which Greer sees no reason to question . <p> As the UK Government specified from the beginning on its website , the measures in the Coronavirus Act 2020 are temporary . <p> The government in Azerbaijan launched a new wave of crackdown on political activists during the covid-19 outbreak . Mammad Mammadzada @mammadzadeh from @smdtemds tells us journalists and human rights defenders face bogus charges and attacks on social media . **26;198;TOOLONG <p> While the human rights organisations understand the necessity of containing the spread of the virus , they also committed to monitoring the action of the Government and stressed the need to focus on the categories of people who are already at risk even in normal conditions . <p> " These are extraordinary times , which require extraordinary measures . It is right the Government takes necessary and proportionate measures to prevent , treat and control the coronavirus , and human rights must be at the centre of its response . " <p> Allen 's opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Greer , everybody 's human rights are affected in a crisis like this . But some people are touched more severely than others . The trouble is , there 's no perfect human rights solution . <p> He conceded : <p> " Even in normal times , there are all kinds of compromises to be struck between human rights , and people may debate whether the balance has been struck in the right place or not . " <p> By closing workplaces , the UK Government also undertook to cover the salary costs and other expenses related to the lockdown . This makes the Professor think that the way it has reacted is broadly appropriate . At the same time , he admits he is not sure the measures are going to be adequate for that segment of the population who relies upon charity . <p> " There 's a big debate in this country about the adequacy of the benefits system for those kinds of people anyway and I suppose this crisis just makes that more acute , " Greer said . <p> In fact , the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in UK public debate . Despite coronavirus being defined as a " great leveller " by many politicians , figures show that some communities are suffering more than others . <p> In particular , people from black , Asian and minority ethnic ( BAME ) backgrounds appear to have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 virus . Even if they only represent the 14% of the UK population , their members affected by coronavirus account for 35% of the patients in intensive care . <p> ' This review needs to be independent , transparent , thorough and most importantly it needs to engage with the communities and individuals affected . ' <p> In the meantime , another instance of inequality has become clear : between the deprived and richest areas . People living in the poorest parts of England and Wales are dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas . This has been revealed by an Office for National Statistics report focused on the period between 1 March and 17 April , 2020 . <p> Even in normal conditions , the human rights to various social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest attainable standards of physical and mental well-being are still unlikely to be easily enjoyed by groups like immigrants , asylum seekers , the homeless and others . <p> Professor Greer told IA : <p> In a developed Western society where there is no crisis , there will be all kinds of people who are vulnerable for all kinds of reasons . And when you 've got a crisis , those vulnerabilities tend to be accentuated . In other words , crises tend to impact much more upon the vulnerable than people who are not vulnerable . <p> A possible crucial " move " in this direction has been made on 3 May , when the Housing secretary Robert Jenrick announced a ? 76 million package to support groups more at risk during the coronavirus lockdown , including children experiencing dangerous situations , rough sleepers and victims of domestic and sexual violence , who will get ' priority need status ' for local housing . Besides this , the allocated resources would keep charity helplines funded and to recruit counsellors for the victims of abuses . <p> The future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding . But what Professor Greer highlights about the reaction to the crisis is the prompt commitment shown by civil society . <p> He said : <p> One of the heartening features of this crisis is the way in which people have resorted to what you might call community-oriented self-help . I live in Bristol and in our streets , some people have gone around putting little notes through the door saying they 're organising volunteers to help and you can contact them on the email or on a mobile phone . So people are looking out for one another , that 's a good thing too , I think . <p> However , there are social groups which wo n't have experience community support : namely those in prison . " Quite a few people , myself included , think that we imprison too many people in this country . That our prisons are overloaded , overcrowded and we should imprison only the most serious offenders , " the Professor said . <p> According to Greer , the fact that a person is imprisoned in itself means their human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on other human rights , including the right to health . " As far as prisoners are concerned , the main responsibility of the authorities is to do their best to ensure that the rest of their rights are as well-protected as possible , " he said . <p> However , prisons are not the easiest environment to safeguard persons within . <p> Professor Greer suggested : <p> Trying to maintain the two-metre distance , for example , is obviously going to be very difficult in an overcrowded prison . Hastening the release of those whose sentences would have been served soon anyway is a good idea . The question then becomes : how far off expected release should this be ? <p> It is surprising the velocity with which the UK Government prepared the 348-page Coronavirus Bill 2020 ( now an Act of Parliament ) in just a few days . <p> Professor Greer offered his take on that : <p> The reason why they were able to get it through so quickly is because successive governments have had drafts ready for this kind of thing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of tweaking , as it were , to deal with this current one . So the human rights issues and all the other ones have been settled quite some time ago . <p> And , when they were discussed , how did it happen ? Professor Greer summarised the UK ordinary process to verify the human rights compliance of the legislation , recognised by most commentators as one of the most effective achievements of the Human Rights Act 1998 , which came into force in the year 2000 . <p> " Since that moment we have had very effective bureaucratic processes for this , both official and unofficial , " Greer said . " The draft legislation does n't even get presented for parliament unless the government has considered its human rights implications . " <p> The Tower Bridge in London , England ( image via Pixabay ) . <p> Then there is a second step , Professor Greer explained : <p> When a minister presents legislation to parliament , he or she has to declare that it 's compatible with human rights , or to invite parliament to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , it goes through the parliamentary process and there 's an institution called the Joint Committee on Human Rights , made of MPs and Lords that scrutinise all legislation to see if they also think it 's compliant with the European Convention . And then you 've got all the NGOs , they also examine and take a view upon legislation and its human rights compliance . <p> It does n't mean that pieces of legislation are n't passed even if they may conflict with human rights . People can take very different positions on about whether the right balance has been struck . This is where the courts become relevant . <p> Greer states , further : <p> If parliament passes a piece of legislation and there 's been some controversy about it , complainants can still take litigation to the courts . The higher courts can declare a piece of legislation incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights and then it gets sent back to Parliament to be corrected , and in most cases parliament does correct it . <p> This highlights how the UK is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this is because the main human rights machinery in Europe does n't come from the European Union , it comes from the Council of Europe in Strasbourg , a 47-member organisation hosting the European Court of Human Rights . <p> Leaving the European Union did n't affect this . The UK is still a member of the Council of Europe , still subject to the jurisdiction of the mentioned Court , so classic civil liberties , civil and political rights , are still going to govern the State 's conduct . However , Brexit will have some ramifications in the way the emergency is handled . <p> Terrorism , health pandemics and of course climate change are global problems . So problems that people need to solve together . And the more we 're in institutions that encourage and facilitate cooperation between nations , the better . In cutting ourselves off from European unity , we 've made it more difficult for ourselves and for the European Union to have common policies about this kind of crisis . <p> Professor Greer was quite surprised when we mentioned that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the quarantine , talked about the risk of ending up in " martial law " as a consequence of the lockdown . <p> We asked him if in his opinion their concerns could be justified : <p> I do n't think any serious commentator has made that accusation . Martial law requires the courts to be closed . All the normal institutions of government do n't function and basically the army 's in charge of everything . That 's not happening at all . That 's a complete misconception . <p> As we observed in the last two month , British civil society has found an essential motivation for the effort to stay home : protecting the National Health System ( NHS ) . <p> Professor Greer concluded : <p> If people perceive that the health service is under threat -- as it is by this crisis -- they will make the sacrifice as required . One of the most reassuring things about the management of this crisis is , on every occasion , the Prime Minister himself has appeared at the press briefings flanked by the Chief Scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been proposed is science-based , relying upon the science as it is being understood by our experts . <p> Of course , that raises the question of how come scientists in other countries have come to different conclusions and that 's a difficult question to address . But you put your finger on a very big question which is the legitimacy of different ways of dealing with crises . Ordinary people , they understand . <p> As we close the conversation , two more debates come to the fore : regarding the coronavirus contact-tracking app and the possibility for journalists to speak directly with the healthcare professionals in order to report on COVID-19 . <p> While Greer is not particularly afraid of the app if this is useful to tackle the pandemic , he looks much more worried about the warnings against hospital workers allegedly prevented from speaking with reporters . <p> " Threats of disciplinary action against NHS employees for revealing shortages of PPE and other failings in the way the pandemic is being tackled ca n't be defended if the allegations are true , " Greer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He emphasised : <p> " It is not only a violation of the right to freedom of expression but it stifles the disclosure of information that would contribute to the crisis being more effectively managed . " <p> As if to say , freedom of information is the foundation of social evolution . And , at this moment , the priority we give to the human right to health must be balanced , by having the Government renounce any attempt to stop health workers from shedding light on the malfunctions in the management of this pandemic . <p> IA is dedicated to providing fearless , independent journalism , free for all , with no barriers .

Masks ? Who can we meet with ? What if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full ? If some areas can reopen while others ca n't , will there be roadblocks between them ? <p> This was n't so much a " roadmap " to freedom as an obstacle course . It 's one that not even the headmaster is sure his pupil will finish . <h> ' Key parts remain frustratingly unexplained ' <p> Asa Bennett : Boris Johnson could not have been more thankful for how diligently the British people have respected the lockdown , recognising that the " hardships " and " colossal cost " shouldered by the nation had prevented " what could have been a catastrophe " in coronavirus deaths . <p> So how did he want to repay us ? By asking the nation to hang on a while longer , but indicating that we need not fear the police pouncing if we choose to sit in the local park anymore . That was a concession Nicola Sturgeon notably did not allow Scots , so the English will no doubt take his permission to sunbathe with glee . <p> Slowly but surely , the Prime Minister is beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules in the hope of soon reaching the light at the end of the tunnel , he sought to show how much tunnel we had left . <p> All being well , he indicated that schools would start to open in the coming weeks , with non-essential shops to follow from July . But there was a limit on how detailed the Prime Minister could be , as he confessed his plan could not be concrete . Instead it was a " shape " of a plan , a " first sketch of a roadmap " out of lockdown . <p> Schools will remain closed until at least June 1Credit : Catherine Ivill/Getty Images <p> Some parts of the plan the government had trailed online were frustratingly unexplained , such as the suggestion that we would now be asked to " limit contact " with other people - raising the prospect of meticulously socially distanced meetings with friends and family . <p> At very least , the irrepressible optimist Prime Minister was able to show the nation how close we are to exiting what he saw as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a role to play " , suggesting only our continued efforts will help him get us through this fog-filled journey . <h> Truth is the Government 's failures are undermining PM 's message <p> Daniel Capurro : The intended message could not have been clear enough . We , the British public , have made extraordinary sacrifices in the face of this pandemic and it is these sacrifices that have saved lives . Yet they must continue because , were we to relent , those lives would be at risk again . <p> However , when the Prime Minister recapitulated his five tests for easing the restrictions , another , underlying message almost slipped out . It is our sacrifices that are keeping this invisible monster at bay , but it is this Government 's failures that are undermining our efforts . <p> Mr Johnson briefly acknowledged the continuing disastrous situation in care homes and the spread of the coronavirus in hospitals . It is these that place us at greatest risk of another surge in the virus , acting as seedbeds for renewed outbreaks . <p> The Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The PM also dwelt for a fleeting moment on the lack of personal protective equipment and the absence of testing capacity . But it was left to the viewer to join up the dots -- the lack of PPE and the lack of testing are what has allowed those twin crises to persist . <p> All this might be forgivable if the PM 's message had carried some understanding of what the British public is going through , but it did n't . There was a clear effort to be rousing , with a rising voice and arms flailed , yet it was a broadcast remarkably lacking in Mr Johnson 's famed common touch . <p> Yes , last night 's message was intended to focus on the economy . But the total absence of any mention of friends or family was deeply surprising . After almost two months in lockdown , the question most people will be asking first is not " when can I go to the cinema ? "

@@71842041 <h> Ravanera : Not ' Survival of the Fittest ' but through cooperation <p> I WILL survive the onslaught of coronavirus because I am very strong . That is wrong . That dictum " Survival of the Fittest " is wrong ! There is now an evolving consciousness that Darwin 's theory of Survival of the Fittest is flawed and must be debunked , a wrong concept that has given way to a roadmap of paradigm that has justified the gross inequities and social injustices in a world where a few oligarchs are in control , that is , if " fittest " is equated to the strongest , the most aggressive who will defeat anyone who dare to challenge to dominate . That dictum only applies to a jungle-like existence like hungry wolves competing who is the one who will eat a cornered prey . <p> The " survival of the fittest " principle only survives in a highly competitive world . Certainly , the strongest wins . But competition only works in paradigm called the Neo-Liberal Capitalism concretized by globalization where the global corporations rule through exclusion of the poor and the oppressed . We must understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human societies . The scientist and philosopher Peter Kropotkin writes : " If we ask nature who are the fittest : those who are continuously at war with each other or those who support one another ? " We at once see that the animals which acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest . They have more chances to survive and they attain , in their respective classes , the highest development of intelligence and bodily organization . " <p> That mindset of the strongest controlling everything has worked for the beasts in a world where the name of the game is survival . It should not be the case now where the name of the game should be sharing , cooperation and service . <p> It is horrible even to contemplate the present economic order in a world where only eight families have a total wealth equivalent to the total assets of more than 3.6 billion earthlings based on a study by Oxfam . I can only surmise that these billionaires with their tremendous financial rakings at the expense of the people and the environment are justifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittest and they are the fittest who would crash down anyone in business . No sir ! Enough is enough of so much unbridled materialism and consumerism . That theory has reduced man who is an embodied spirit created by God in His image and likeness to being just a beast . That flawed theory has spawned a wrong development paradigm called Neo-Liberal Capitalism , a growth-at-all-cost development strategy that has sacrificed Mother Earth and the people to the altar of greed and profit . History tells us how man has become so dominating that wars have to be resorted every time threats to one 's domain loom . <p> There is no need to live in that jungle-like world anymore . The universe is unfolding so fast that there are so many things to do , to know , to discover and to explore . No need to prove who is the best but the only path is to cooperate , to work together , to be one so that humanity can journey to a higher level towards spirituality . Each one of us is a stream of consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards that Ocean of Consciousness called Love , called God ! <p> So the meaning now of the " fittest , " is the most cooperative , the most loving , the most service-oriented .

That specie now has evolved to be Homo Pacem or Espiritus Luminus , men and women for peace and enlightened spirits as they are now connected to that Ocean of Love called God ! <p> Indeed , man is more spiritual than being a body so we must not " live by bread alone . " Even King Solomon in the Ecclesiastes said that power , wealth , titles -- these are meaningless , utterly meaningless . What is important is what is in our hearts and how we live to advance what is good , what is true and what is just .

Tayong lahat ay ginawa ng Panginoon , para sa isa't isa . " <p> The shift now is from self-aggrandizement to collective power .

But Tuesday was the first time the governor publicly revealed initial concrete steps to reach specific numerical goals . <p> " We want to give everybody out there and everybody watching the confidence that we have got the infrastructure in place so that as we begin to reopen the state , they know we 're on it , that we can spot community spread or a flare-up with very short notice , " Murphy said .

@@71956741 <p> As everyone ponders how all economies move into the next phase of Covid-19 - some in the financial markets are starting to think about , how are the shutdowns going to be funded and what will need to be funded ? <p> There is no doubt that most Governments of the world took drastic action to protect their citizens and any cost of that protection was not considered at the time . This was an entirely appropriate response , but it will have dramatic long term implications . <p> To assess , first , let 's look at the various starting points . How much debt did countries have at the start of the crisis ? <p> The last column on the Bloomberg table below ( Figure 1 ) compares debt-to-GDP across developed markets . <p> Figure 1 : source : Bloomberg <p> These number are enormous ... and they are the starting point . <p> As a global borrower , it is important to know who owns your debt and why do they own it ? <p> In the case of Japan , ranking number one on the Bloomberg table , - a vast percentage of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , whereas in Greece , coming in second , the debt profile was owned by hedge funds and institutions , which caused much heartache for the Greek people . <h> What next ? <p> All governments will need to issue debt to fund their obligations to their citizens . When you read " citizens " intellectually substitute the word " voters " , because the present crisis might be a circumstance where " I vote , I need work " could be the next bumper sticker . <p> In order to imagine how governments can respond to voter concerns , it might be best to understand what they themselves will be dealing with . <p> Debt to GDP is the countries ' debt ( numerator ) as a percentage of GDP ( denominator ) . What should analysts assume the denominator will look like for 2020 ? What about even 2021 right through to 2025 ? There are over 30 million unemployed in the US in one month . <p> Who can , with complete confidence , decide what the GDP will look like forany country ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is that no one really knows at what velocity ; what will the bounce in activity look like ? Will consumers consume , comfortable that all will be good , no recurrence in pandemics , and that companies will continue to put employee and customer welfare before profits ? <p> I think it is reasonable to presume the denominator will struggle to grow for the foreseeable future , remembering for most investors a month can hold a lifetime of investing experiences , so a five year horizon is the equivalent of a Star Trek light year . <h> The numerator <p> This is where the rubber really hits the road because we have been told by Treasury what to expect for upcoming issuance . <p> The US Treasury announced on 6 May , that its funding requirement for the next quarter is $96 Billion , for one quarter ! By President Trump 's own estimate they have the economy contracting this year by 40% ; the American deficit will groan onwards to $4 trillion . These numbers are easy to write but nearly impossible to comprehend . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment - then overlay it , with the needs of Europe , Japan , China , Latin America and the rest of the world . <h> Why does funding deficits matter ? <p> America , particularly under Donald Trump 's leadership , is not a " cap in hand " borrower . There seems to be very little diplomacy . Think back to the GFC and then Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson flying to China to assure the Chinese investors that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would redeem their debts even if the government had to step in . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the funding entities that provide funding for mortgages in the US . <p> There is no evidence on the surface that America recognises that it might have any challenge funding $4 trillion in debt ... remember those debt ceiling arguments during the Obama Administration ? <p> If there is an investor boycott in any form , then we could see a significant steepening of the bond curve ... " Houston , we have a problem ! " , America will either cut spending , hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or pay the higher coupon on the bond and hope the economy rebounds , which is assuming a very weak US Dollar . <p> I do n't like any of those strategies and this is all based on the assumption that $4 trillion is enough to kick start an economy that was n't increasing in headline revenue prior to the Covid-19 pandemic . <h> What do investors do ? <p> Australia is not in as precarious a situation as most other countries , as Figure 1 highlights . <p> I do n't provide advice , personal , investment or otherwise . With these circumstances , I can see a situation that investors may need to take different risks where cash rates are so low predominantly in the short end . Investors who decide to buy long dated government bonds will have revalue risk . The theory is if rates go higher after you invest , there will be a capital loss if you sell that bond in the market . This is a critical issue for fund managers , but if rates in the short end go to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savers . <p> Therefore , it could be valuable to decide if a part of your portfolio is dedicated to income , and if so , is there a long-dated bond that can meet your requirements ? <p> Again on the premise that I do n't provide any advice , but discern as a keen observer , I would watch to see how markets are responding to the increased issuance - and if you can achieve a compelling rate taking Australian government risk , then it is at least worth exploring through your own independent research or via a fund manager . <p> Mark Todd <p> Head of Fixed Income , Bank of China <p> Bank of China has a commercial interest ( in the assets ) printed in this article . <p> Bank of China does not provide investment or personal advice . <p> Investors should seek its own independent and appropriate advice that is suitable for their investment needs .

There are a lot of people having worse issues , but it 's hard because basketball means a lot to these guys . " <p> Next for NYSPHSAA to determine is the fate of the springs season .

" The doubt and looking back with unanswered questions will be the most difficult thing that comes out of this in the long run . <p> " It 's more than just those kids who will have long college careers and eventually this will be a blip on the radar .

" <p> Risser had a few optimistic notes , saying the pandemic might help the medical community develop better forms of telemedicine , so patients can get needed advice when they ca n't or should n't visit a clinic or hospital . And he thinks there 's a good chance California Gov .

One thing it reveals is Australia 's glaring need for a Chief Pharmacist , says Karalyn Huxhagen <p> For me the biggest and most complex issue that has been highlighted ( and it is an age-old issue ) is that we need an Australian Chief Pharmacist and we need a national system of legislation . <p> When I joined PSA in 1981 we had this state by state issue with legislation that affected our ability to change regulations and policy . Every state had an overriding jurisdiction that differed so no matter what we passed as National law the states could meld to their own legislation . <p> It did my head in then , it did my head in when we were writing the Competency Standards and it has done my head in when we wrote legislation in relation to Immunisation , Dispensary Technicians , Scope of practice , Opioid replacement therapy , dispensing and recording Pharmacist Only medications and so much more . <p> In recent years it has caused havoc in times of natural disaster when legislation has been invoked for Continual Dispensing and individual states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a locum I must allocate an area of my brain to remember what I can and can not do in each state .

I agree with them , " Cooper said Friday during a phone interview with The Tennessean . " Of course it 's nothing you would ever do unless you absolutely had to . " <p> Cooper outlined the reasoning behind several facets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the best path forward despite painful decisions that will affect every Nashvillian . <p> " The budget we wanted to present of course was for pay raises for teachers , first responders and employees , neighborhood investment and then things such as body cameras , " he said . " But you are not in the normal budget year . " <p> Here are some excerpts from the interview . <h> Why put $100 million from the property tax increase toward savings ? <p> Cooper said the city will have to lean on meager savings to absorb the impact of COVID-19 through June . <p> Replenishing those funds during the next fiscal year , which starts in July , has become a top priority . Cooper said COVID-19 could pull at least $470 million in tax revenue away from city coffers over a 16-month period . A slower recovery would mean a deeper hit . <p> " We 've learned through this quarter and a situation that is super dire what the hit to our cash is . So we need to have at least that much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> " Various people are gon na say why do you have to get back to the $100 million in cash reserves ? Can it be a lower number ? <p> " The reality is ( $100 million ) is super small for a city our size to begin with , and we 've just seen in this quarter why you have to have 100 million in reserves , that you can blow through those in a quarter . " <h> Are more property tax increases on the table in future budget cycles ? <p> Cooper is proposing a $1 rate increase , pushing the rate to $4.15 in the urban services district . It 's the first tax increase since 2012 . <p> For a home appraised at $250,000 , that would mean an increase of about $625 per year . <p> The mayor described the jump as " a large , terrible , you know , once unthinkable property tax increase . " He seemed eager to avoid pushing for further hikes in the future . <p> " We 're planning for that not to be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super severe , additional crises for that to be necessary . " <p> But he pointed out that the city 's new tax rate would still be lower than it had been before recent cuts -- and it would still rank lowest among the states biggest cities . <p> " Your readers need to know that it is lower than three years ago . When I became a council member , the tax rate was $4.59 . That was in 2015 . " <h> Was it a mistake to lower property taxes in the first place ? <p> Cooper said it was low cash reserves , not a low property tax , that put the city on perilous financial footing . <p> " The reality is even when the tax rate was low ... the gross collections for the city went up substantially . So there was every reason to believe that it could be lowered in that era . Now if you could go back in time , you would probably talk to the councils in the previous years and encourage them to have a higher cash balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say the city made a mistake when it did not raise property taxes in 2017 to correspond with the city 's property reappraisal . Former Mayor Megan Barry declined to push for one , which is common in reappraisal years in order to capture additional revenue from the city 's growth in property values . <p> Cooper 's proposal , which requires council approval , does not explicitly provide funds needed to maintain a 3% raise doled out to school employees in January with city support . <p> School administrators said they would have to scour for more than $15 million in cuts to maintain the raises . But the mayor said he thought schools would be able to take advantage of savings related to COVID-19 . <p> " This school system also has significant savings from not being in operation . So I think the source of funding that 3% already lies within their budget . They 're not operating , they are clearly saving money , right ? So they 're going to be able to redeploy those savings for their priorities . ... <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking them to live within their means , and they have savings from being closed . " <p> Cooper rebuffed the idea that keeping the city allocation flat at $914.9 million was a positive accomplishment during this budget cycle . <p> State law requires at least half of local sales tax revenue to be allocated toward schools . But COVID-19 decimated Nashville sales taxes , imperiling a pivotal revenue stream for the district . <p> " What we 've done is we 've covered the loss of their sales taxes with property taxes , " Cooper said . " It 's a huge thing . And the school board members should go and thank everybody in the county under this budget for accepting that additional responsibility to get our school system to the other side . " <p> Could the financial impact of COVID-19 affect the budget for more than a year ? <p> " Well , yes .

@@84152641 <p> The U.S. conducted airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia group in Iraq , U.S. officials said Thursday , entering into a new phase of a military confrontation with Iran and its allies by retaliating for the deaths earlier this week of two Americans and a British service member . <p> The U.S. strikes targeted five separate weapons storage facilities in Iraq associated with Kataib Hezbollah , a Shiite militia group operating in Iraq that U.S. officials said has frequently targeted bases where American servicemembers are based . <p> The strikes aimed to degrade the group 's ability to conduct future attacks against U.S. and coalition forces , the Pentagon said in a statement late Thursday . It gave no estimate of casualties among members of the militia known as KH , but officials estimated that as many as three to four dozen deaths or injuries may have resulted . <p> The U.S. had been consulting with the British government on the operation , but the retaliatory strikes were conducted by American forces alone , U.S. officials said . <p> The strikes were " defensive and proportional , " the Pentagon said , and were in response to the threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has about 5,000 troops based in Iraq . <p> " The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people , our interests , or our allies , " Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement .

The toll could n't immediately be independently verified , and the Iraqi government did n't comment on the attack . Iranian officials did n't immediately respond to a request for comment . <p> The U.S. strikes came after a series of attacks in recent weeks against bases in Iraq where American military personnel are stationed .

Photo : Getty Images <p> The White House did n't comment on the U.S. strikes . Earlier Thursday , President Trump , asked whether the U.S. was planning to retaliate for the deadly attack in Iraq , hedged his answer . " Let 's put it this way : You will see , " he said . <p> Before the U.S. strikes , military officials did n't identify which group they believed had carried out the attack on Camp Taji , and no group had claimed responsibility .

It also put Iraq back in the crosshairs of a potential flare-up in the simmering conflict between Washington and Tehran . <p> Iraq has proved unable or unwilling to meet U.S. and allied demands in the past to rein in activities of the Iran-backed militias , reflecting the limits of the government 's authority over armed groups that alternately cooperate with and defy the state . <p> The U.S. has sought Iraq 's permission to bring in batteries of Patriot missiles to protect its forces from attack by Iran and its allies .

Gen. Qassem Soleimani , in an airstrike after he arrived at Baghdad airport . <p> Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles against the al-Asad Airbase in Iraq , which houses U.S. troops . The barrage inflicted brain-related trauma on more than 100 American service members , U.S. officials said . <p> Some Iranian officials , and their allies in Iraq , have warned the attack was only the beginning of a response that ultimately aims to dislodge U.S. troops from Iraq . <p> In the wake of Gen. Soleimani 's killing , pro-Iranian lawmakers spearheaded a vote in Iraq 's parliament calling for the expulsion of foreign troops . Those efforts had lately lost some momentum due to political infighting and now the coronavirus outbreak . <p> For Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of upheaval . U.S. sanctions have strained the economy , leading to bouts of unrest over Tehran 's recent austerity measures . <p> More recently , the downing of a Ukrainian airline in January unleashed a fresh wave of protests -- and another deadly security crackdown -- after the government admitted it mistakenly shot the plane down . Iran is now battling one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world . <p> It is also a sensitive moment for Iraq , which is in the throes of a political crisis and faces a budget crunch as oil prices plummet . <p> The death of a U.S. contractor in a similar rocket attack last year prompted the U.S. to launch strikes against the Kataib Hezbollah militia along the Iraq-Syria border . Supporters of the group then attempted to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad . <p> If Iraqi militias were behind this week 's attack , they may have hoped to provoke an American retaliation inside Iraq to fuel popular anger against the American presence in the country , said Afshon Ostovar , an expert on Iran and Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif . <p> " I suspect this was aimed at reigniting the push to expel U.S. forces from Iraq by baiting a U.S. response , " Mr. Ostovar said . " If Iran is involved , it seems like folly . But the context of coronavirus makes this situation unusually difficult to read . Who knows what they 're thinking . "

Its testing outreach program includes home visits for people suspected of having contact with sick patients . Through such measures , South Korea seems to have flattened the curve of its outbreak . <p> China , on the other hand , initially suppressed information about the virus , allowing it to spread from the city of Wuhan .

The United States , meanwhile , has more than twenty-seven million uninsured people , and many more underinsured .

Media outlets in these Asian states and territories have generally not downplayed the threat or promoted conspiracy theories about the virus . And their governments have empowered the private sector to create tests , a step the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is belatedly taking . They have also poured resources into nationwide public information campaigns and have made free testing almost universally available .

However , about 48 percent of the respondents said that they would plan to travel only by the end of 2020 considering lockdown is lifted sometime soon . <p> The main concern expressed by a majority of respondents was the fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , 43.9 percent people prefer to stay indoors and take precautions as much as possible , whereas the other 36.7 percent of respondents want to work to make up for the salary crunch .

The international flight operations will take longer as several nations have imposed travel restrictions and banned the entry of expatriates and foreign nationals .

People in lockdown are waiting eagerly to be outdoors . They want to witness wide-open skies , an expanse of ocean , acres of lush green forest , snow-capped mountains , and a long route journey to get rid of stress and anxiety . No doubt , tourism and travel will be in an extremely different phase after the quarantine . Customers are more likely than ever to select those destinations and hotels that practise responsible tourism and utmost safety standards .

Through this predictive modelling approach , the researchers identified new vaccine designs that could help reduce overall rates of disease . <p> S. pneumoniae is often found at the back of the nasal cavity , where it is normally harmless . But when it migrates to other parts of the body , it can cause serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia , sepsis and meningitis - known collectively as invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) . IPD was estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of widespread vaccination , with higher rates of disease in many low- or middle- income countries* . Infants and the elderly are most at risk . <p> Vaccines against pneumococcus have prevented millions of infections . But like many bacteria , S. pneumoniae is difficult to target with vaccines because infection can be caused by different serotypes** . Each part of a vaccine usually protects against a single serotype , with the most complex pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) targeting 13 serotypes . <p> Because there are approximately 100 S. pneumoniae serotypes around the world , vaccine effectiveness varies between countries depending on which serotypes are present . When serotypes are removed from circulation by a particular vaccine , other serotypes of S. pneumoniae rise to take their place . <p> In this study , researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute , Simon Fraser University and Imperial College London optimised a computer model to approximate the effect of vaccines targeting different serotype combinations . Analysis of vaccine effectiveness was then carried out on S. pneumoniae genomic data from Massachusetts , USA and the Maela refugee camp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many designs are possible , each with different effects on disease . In Maela , for example , the presence of 64 S. pneumoniae serotypes means around 100 trillion vaccine designs are possible .

The researchers developed a more efficient method that made it feasible to identify the best-performing designs from the trillions of possibilities . <p> The team discovered that rates of infant IPD in Maela could actually be reduced by omitting components from the PCV13 vaccine to keep certain serotypes in place , removing the possibility of their replacement by highly-invasive serotypes . In Massachusetts , a vaccine targeting 20 serotypes was found to be more effective than the current PCV13 . <p> The results highlight the need for vaccine programmes to be tailored to specific communities of bacteria and to consider vaccination at different ages . <p> Dr Nicholas Croucher , of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis , Imperial College London , said : " Our research shows that the best vaccine designs strongly depend on the bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries .

In many places , older adults already receive an S. pneumoniae vaccine , which was designed before the infant vaccine . The study also found that adult disease rates could be reduced by almost 50 per cent by redesigning adult vaccines to complement those administered to infants . <p> Professor Caroline Colijn , of Simon Fraser University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute , said : " This approach to optimising vaccines will help to address several problems , such as invasive disease among infants or adults and minimising antibiotic resistance in the post vaccine population .

Safdar said she was not allowed to reveal the exact number of children who 've come to her hospital with the disease , but said , " It 's very few .

But because children have better immune protection than older adults , they are getting far less ill . <p> The reason , he believes , is that as people get older they rely more and more on the innate immune system , which is more of a first-responder to viruses and foreign invaders . <p> The innate system is not precisely targeted like the adaptive immune system , which makes antibodies that are specific to a virus or bacteria . Willoughby compared the adaptive immune system to a hospital , where patients receive more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Willoughby explains it , the innate immune system is " designed to shoot first and ask questions later .

Although children have n't seen the virus either , their immune systems are stronger and better able to handle the onslaught . <p> At UW Health , Safdar said the reason children have been less severely affected by COVID-19 is not entirely certain .

" <p> The enhanced mission has been months in the making but has taken on greater urgency following last week 's indictment of Maduro , Venezuela 's embattled socialist leader , and members of his inner circle and military . They are accused of leading a narcoterrorist conspiracy responsible for smuggling up to 250 metric tons of cocaine a year into the U.S. , about half of it by sea . <p> " If I was just indicted for drug trafficking by the United States , with a $15 million reward for my capture , having the U.S. Navy conducting anti-drug operations off my coast would be something I would worry about , " said Sen.

@@71703941 <h> More <h> Cracks appear in the cult of Xi <p> For 30 years , China 's Communist Party has had an unwritten contract with its people : we 'll deliver growth and wealth , you accept one-party rule . Now , the coronavirus is threatening that and Xi Jinping 's plan to rule for life . <p> Xi Jinping 's grip on power has been weakened by the government 's handling of the coronavirus . David Rowe <p> The turning point for Xi Jinping came on a cold Thursday night a fortnight ago . <p> Millions of people were holed up at home throughout China , hunched over mobile phones scrolling for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak . The country was at a standstill and the infection rate in Wuhan , the city at the centre of the outbreak , was showing no signs of slowing down . <p> Frustration had turned to anxiety as weeks of being trapped in tiny apartments with relatives looked like stretching into months . <p> It was at this low point that the first online posts by journalists in Wuhan appeared , reporting that Li Wenliang , a young doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm about the virus before it became public , had died . <p> Hours of confusion followed , with authorities saying the doctor was still alive after he was put on a life support machine to keep his blood circulating even though his heart had stopped . They eventually confirmed his death . <p> This was the final injustice for many outraged over the death of a man who lost his life to an outbreak he tried to prevent . Li was accused by the police of " spreading rumours " when he raised concerns about the virus , which is now known as COVID-19 , in early January , weeks before it was acknowledged by the government . <p> This touches at the very core of what a state is supposed to do -- keep its people safe and healthy , and that has n't occurred here . <p> -- Jude Blanchette , head of China studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington <p> The outpouring of anger on social media , the only way for China 's citizens to express their dissatisfaction , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " death of a hero " were some of the hashtags trending on the Twitter-like platform Weibo . <p> Xu Zhangrun , an outspoken law professor in Beijing , wrote in an online critique of Xi : " The coronavirus epidemic has revealed the rotten core of Chinese governance . The anger of the people is like a volcano and people , thus enraged , may also cast aside their fear . " Xu has since been reportedly placed under house arrest . <p> It was a seminal moment for President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party . After successfully deflecting much of the blame for failing to contain the outbreak earlier to local government officials in Wuhan , online outrage was now drifting in Beijing 's direction . <p> Advertisement <p> People wanted to know why the centralised system of government reinforced under Xi 's seven-year reign had failed to respond earlier to the kind of crisis he had promised to protect them from .

Unlike during the 2003 SARS epidemic when China 's economy was growing at double-digit rates , the latest outbreak comes as growth is easing . For the past two decades , a huge leap in the standard of living meant most Chinese citizens enjoyed far more comfortable lives than their parents . This has overshadowed any discontent they may have had with their rulers . <p> Advertisement <p> But as growth slows , this increases the risk for instability if people can not put food on the table .

Along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several contacts reported their accounts on China 's widely used messaging app , WeChat , were closed down after they made critical remarks in a private message . <p> On February 13 , Xi ousted the two most senior Communist Party officials from Hubei province at the centre of the outbreak . He replaced the top official with one of his close allies , former Shanghai mayor Ying Yong . Around the same time he appointed another supporter , Xia Baolong , as head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office , which oversees politically charged Hong Kong . <p> " He sent loyalists to both Wuhan and Hong Kong . That indicates it is a white knuckle moment for him , " says McGregor . " Xi wants to have people in there he totally trusts .

This refers to the 1986 nuclear disaster in the former Soviet Union which accelerated the demise of the already weakened Communist Party there . <p> They are likely to be disappointed . While the economy is slowing , China 's Communist rulers are battling the outbreak from a far superior position than the Soviets . Even in Wuhan , where millions are quarantined in their homes , people still have food , electricity and the internet . <p> " I think it is a huge exaggeration to say the coronavirus is in any way a threat to the survival of the regime , " says Alexander Downer , who was Australia 's foreign minister during China 's last major health crisis , when SARS ravaged the country in 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Magazine in October 2012 .

" <p> By Friday , China had reported 2236 deaths and 75,465 infections from the respiratory virus , which is believed to have originated from a seafood market in Wuhan in December . After more than a month of closures , the country 's cities are limping back to life . <p> This is not something Xi was counting on when his power peaked in early 2018 . He oversaw a change in the constitution to abolish presidential terms and effectively make himself leader for life . A cult of personality had been building up around the 66-year-old General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for years and it was impossible to go anywhere in China without seeing his picture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page of a newspaper . <p> A consolidation of power saw Xi in control of the police , the military , the courts and other vitals organs of government power . " Xi Jinping has more clout than Donald Trump , " The Economist declared in an October 2017 cover story . <p> Advertisement <p> Forward to the current day and Xi 's image as an invincible strongman has faded considerably , at least on the world stage . He is still adored by hundreds of millions in China and criticising the President is close to blasphemy for true believers . <p> For others , it is simply too risky in an age of unprecedented surveillance where even one-on-one messages on mobile phones are monitored . While some critics believe this reduces his chances of serving a third term as president in 2022 , political analysts say retirement is not an option . <p> It is not the first time China 's leaders have faced a public backlash over their response to a crisis . A 2008 earthquake in Sichuan which killed 70,000 people , a tainted milk scandal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-speed rail crash all attracted widespread criticism . <p> " What is different this time is that it is not just intellectuals but ordinary people speaking out most boldly on social media . I 'm not sure how often that has happened in the past , " says John Fitzgerald , an emeritus professor at Melbourne 's Swinburne University . <p> " My sense is that it 's both a serious challenge to the party and that the party will ride it out all the same . " <p> While China has been praised for its excessive but effective measures to quarantine huge swathes of its population , officials in Wuhan were under fire for ignoring warnings about a mysterious new virus , which first appeared in late December . Millions left the city in the following weeks for the annual Chinese New Year migration , spreading the virus throughout China and around the world . <p> Chinese President Xi Jinping , pictured left in a face mask , has his temperature taken on February 10 in his first public appearance after the outbreak occurred . AP <p> By January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days later China locked down the city of Wuhan , which has 11 million residents . While independent Chinese media were covering the outbreak honestly with an unusual amount of freedom from the censors , state media largely ignored the outbreak and focused on Xi 's state visit to Myanmar . Xi himself made few public appearances as the crisis accelerated , something that also did not sit well with people . <p> There are also signs that Beijing has lost control of the narrative . <p> Advertisement <p> The Communist Party journal Qiushi published a speech last Saturday which Xi gave to a Politburo Standing Committee meeting a month earlier . In that speech , Xi said he first gave orders to address the coronavirus outbreak at a meeting as early as January 7 . While the release of the speech was designed to demonstrate that China 's leaders were on top of the problem early , it backfired . Critics asked why they failed to act at the time . <h> Biggest challenge awaits <p> For now , at least , many of China 's 1.4 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Wuhan , local residents who spoke to AFR Weekend by telephone said they were angry at how the government was dealing with the crisis but more concerned about getting through it than looking for someone to blame . <p> Some believe the Communist Party will emerge from the crisis even stronger by selling the message that the concentration of power under Xi was how the country got through it . <p> " The Chinese government is good at managing a crisis , " says prominent Shanghai lawyer Ji Shijun . " They can reverse a negative event and change it into a positive one . The impressive efficiency in controlling the epidemic will help the party and Chinese government to get strong support from the public . " <p> This can be seen in the news stories hailing the rapid construction of hospitals in Wuhan , the mobilisation of medical support and a " people 's war " which has seen tens of thousands of community volunteers keeping the infection at bay through strict home quarantine rules . <p> As people 's lives return to normal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be Xi 's biggest challenge . The internal debate about the level of stimulus needed without setting off a debt bomb will be tricky . <p> But when the dust settles and people go back to work , the economic and societal upheaval of the past month will have changed China forever . Fitzgerald , however , says some things will never change . <p> " We should not think that China is democratic in the sense that if people will complain , the Party will respond . No , the Party will repress -- particularly if there is any criticism of the Party itself or their officials .

Israel 's high court heard petitions Sunday that seek to block Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a government because he has been charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may form a new government while under indictment for corruption charges , clearing the way for him and his rival-turned-uneasy ally to join together in a controversial power-sharing deal . <p> The unanimous decision , released just before midnight , ended a 17-month political stalemate and prevented the country from plunging into a fourth consecutive election in just over a year . Netanyahu and his rival-turned-partner , Benny Gantz , said they expected their coalition to be sworn into office next week . <p> After battling to three inconclusive elections over the past year , Netanyahu and Gantz , a former military chief , announced their " emergency " government last month , saying they would put aside their rivalry to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis . <p> Critics and good-government groups said the deal was illegal and challenged it in the Supreme Court . They argued that the law should bar an official charged with serious crimes from continuing as prime minister . They also objected to the newly created position of " alternate prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office throughout his corruption trial and a potential appeals process . <p> Over two days this week , the court looked at two questions : whether an indicted politician can be given authority to form a new government , and whether the power-sharing deal -- which includes new legislation -- was legal . <p> In its decision , the 11-judge panel expressed misgivings about the coalition agreement and Netanyahu 's criminal indictment , but found no grounds to prevent the government from taking office . <p> " We did not find any legal reason to prevent MK ( Member of Knesset ) Netanyahu from forming a government , " the court said . <p> " The legal conclusion we reached does not diminish the severity of the pending charges against MK Netanyahu for violations of moral integrity and the difficulty derived from the tenure of a prime minister accused of criminal activity , " it added . <p> The judges ruled that while the coalition deal presents significant legal difficulties , the court would not interfere in its contents following changes submitted by Netanyahu and Gantz . <p> Netanyahu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting bribes in a series of scandals involving trading favors with wealthy media moguls . His trial is set to start later this month . <p> Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing , and since his indictment last fall , he has repeatedly lashed out at the country 's legal system . He and his political allies have taken special aim at the high court , accusing it of overreach and political interference . <p> As the court was meeting earlier this week , Netanyahu urged it not to get involved in political affairs , lest it risk dragging the country toward new elections . The long-time leader 's opponents consider the court a bastion of democracy under dangerous assault and had expressed hope it would strike down what they see as a deal that undermines the public 's faith in government . <p> Eliad Shraga , a lawyer representing one of the petitioners against the coalition deal , expressed disappointment but said he would respect the decision . " We will continue to raise the flag of morality , " he told Channel 12 news . <p> With the court hurdle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps before they can move ahead with their deal : pass the legislation needed to pave the way for their convoluted coalition agreement and amass the signatures of 61 lawmakers -- a parliamentary majority -- in favor of Netanyahu as prime minister-designate to be sent to Israel 's ceremonial president by a midnight Thursday deadline . <p> With more than a majority of the Knesset 's support , including from Gantz ' party , both steps appear to be easily attainable . <p> Throughout three bruising campaigns , Gantz repeatedly vowed never to sit in a government with Netanyahu . And after March elections , a narrow majority of lawmakers endorsed him as prime minister . Gantz began preparing legislation that would have banned Netanyahu from continuing as prime minister . <p> But in a sudden about face , Gantz accepted an invitation to form a partnership with Netanyahu to confront the coronavirus crisis , infuriating many of his supporters and causing his Blue and White party to split in half . <p> Last month , the two sides agreed on a coalition deal that makes the two men equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions . Because of its unorthodox arrangement , the Knesset must pass new legislation before they take office . <p> Under the deal , Netanyahu and Gantz would be sworn in together , with Netanyahu serving first as prime minister and Gantz as the designated premier . After 18 months , the two are to swap positions . The new position will enjoy all the trappings of the prime minister , including an official residence and , key for Netanyahu , an exemption from a law that requires public officials who are not prime minister to resign if charged with a crime . <p> Netanyahu is eager to remain in office throughout his trial , using his position to lash out at the judicial system and rally support among his base . The coalition deal also gives him influence over key judicial appointments , creating a potential conflict of interest during an appeals process if he is convicted . His trial was postponed in March due to restrictions his hand-picked interim justice minister placed on the courts after the coronavirus crisis erupted and is scheduled to commence later this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a conflict of interest arrangement while prime minister whenever dealing with law enforcement affairs . <p> Under the deal , the sides agreed not to take immediate action on key appointments and prioritize legislation focusing on reviving Israel 's economy from the coronavirus crisis . <p> But it makes an exception for Netanyahu to press ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank , including all of Israel 's dozens of settlements there . Netanyahu is permitted to push the issue through parliament after July 1 , even without Gantz 's support . <p> Netanyahu and his hardline supporters are eager to annex the territory while the friendly administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is in office .

He added that the number of sexual misconduct cases involving student perpetrators per 1,000 students hovered at 0.21 , 0.21 and 0.2 over the last three years showing " no discernible trend " . <p> PENALTIES <p> Of the 56 cases , the victims in 37 cases reported the crime to the police . Four cases are still under investigation and there was insufficient evidence to make out offences in two of them , he said . <p> Of the remaining 31 , 10 cases were " serious offences " and resulted in jail terms of between 10 days and eight months , Mr Ong said . These include cases of outrage of modesty or multiple instances of voyeurism . <p> In addition to police investigations , the universities also carry out their own disciplinary processes and mete out a combination of penalties within its power . These range from official reprimand which will be reflected in a student 's formal educational record , to suspensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 56 cases are still awaiting disciplinary hearings , while four students have withdrawn from the university before sanctions were imposed . <p> Out of the remaining 47 cases , 34 resulted in an official reprimand , 26 resulted in suspension of up to two academic terms and 20 were banned from entering students ' dormitories . <p> " They do not add up to 47 because cases typically receive a combination of penalties , " Mr Ongsaid . <p> In determining appropriate sanctions in each case , Mr Ongsaid the university 's disciplinary body takes into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating factors , such as how remorseful and forthcoming the offender was during investigations , the potential for rehabilitation , and the presence of any mental health issues . <p> For offenders with psychiatric conditions , mandatory counselling and psychological treatment will be required . <p> " But if we look at the 10 police cases involving serious offences which led to jail sentences , there was only one expulsion , which was subsequently reduced to an 18-month suspension after appeal and taking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ongsaid . <p> AUs WILL NEED TO REVIEW THEIR DISCIPLINARY FRAMEWORK <p> He said that there are " two strong reasons " why the universities ' disciplinary frameworks need to be reviewed to strengthen the penalties . <p> First , there is a need to " better balance " the objectives of deterrence and redress for the victims against rehabilitation of the offender . <p> " Balancing these objectives is important for an education institution , but it should not end up with penalties that are too lenient and have too soft a bite , " Mr Ong said . <p> " ' Two strikes and you 're out ' can not be the standard application . But neither should expulsions be the default for all forms of misconduct , " he added . <p> There has to be a " significant " adjustment at the most egregious end of the spectrum of misconducts when they are serious criminal offences that undermine the safety and security of university campuses , he said . <p> Mr Ongadded that if the offender is remorseful and has accepted and been served punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Singapore must recognise that voyeurism is a growing concern . With growing exposure to the Internet at an early age and technological advances that have made video recording easier and more undetectable , this has led some to think that voyeurism is not a serious offence . <p> " The young today grow up with the Internet . They are exposed to pornography websites . They know of miniature photography and recording devices and sometimes they get it through their WhatsApp . Over time , they may have the idea that this is no big deal . This is what we are worried about . It does n't manifest in terms of higher incidence rates , at least over the last three years ... but we do worry about this underlying trend , " Mr Ong said . <p> " As our circumstances change , the AUs must likewise keep up with the times and ensure that their policies and processes remain relevant in establishing a safe and supportive environment for all students , " the minister said . <p> Across AUs , polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Educations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . <p> MP Foo Mee Har asked if MOE would consider prescribing minimum standards to the disciplinary actions that will be meted out for as the universities are reviewing its disciplinary frameworks . <p> In response , Mr Ong said that the ministry needs to respect the autonomy of AUs in having their own board and governing themselves , separate from MOE . <p> " For us to issue standards , codes or rules to the universities , I think it would not be appropriate . We can do that for polytechnics because they are statutory boards and for ITEs , " Mr Ong explained . <p> OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON CHARACTER OF SOCIETY <p> Mr Ong said the strong reaction to Ms Monica Baey 's situation showed that people in Singapore have a strong sense of justice , who see the importance of differentiating between right and wrong . <p> " But we should always refrain from trial by media , doxxing and resorting to mob justice . No matter how wrong an offender is , we need to respect the due process , " Mr Ong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment for Nicholas Lim came from social media .

Bowser of Washington said on Thursday that the city could begin a phased reopening as early as May 29 , pointing to figures that showed a downward trend in spread of the virus for almost two weeks . Yet on the same day , Washington , D.C. , and Virginia announcedsingle-day highs in cases . <p> The Washington region 's high positive-test percentage comes despite reassuring news in most states : 42 have a rate under 10 percent of positive test results as part of a rolling , seven-day average , Dr. Birx said . <p> The New York area , which includes Jersey City and Newark , is seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .

On Friday , Mr. Dreiband also warned ina letter to Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles that a " long-term lockdown " could be illegal . <p> The move in Illinois came in a lawsuit that was filed by Darren Bailey , a Republican state representative whose fellow lawmakers kicked him out of the building in which they had gathered because he refused to wear a mask .

United Airlines would be able to stop flights to Fairbanks , Alaska ; Kalamazoo , Mich. ; and Myrtle Beach , S.C. , among other locations . <p> None of the cities would be left without service , the agency said , because it granted exemptions only if other airlines still flew there .

Luke Sharrett for The New York Times <p> When she found out in mid-March that she had landed an internship with an education nonprofit in Washington , Lydia Burns , a senior at the University of Louisville , called her mother to celebrate . <p> The euphoria lasted all of a week . As she worked on a paper the next Tuesday , Ms. Burns got an email from the nonprofit : The internship was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic . She burst into tears . <h> How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S. ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April , data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed , and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners . Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work , compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000 , a Fed official said . <h> How can I protect myself while flying ? <p> If air travel is unavoidable , there are some steps you can take to protect yourself . Most important : Wash your hands often , and stop touching your face . If possible , choose a window seat . A study from Emory University found that during flu season , the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window , as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people . Disinfect hard surfaces . When you get to your seat and your hands are clean , use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seatbelt buckle , the remote , screen , seat back pocket and the tray table . If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather , you can wipe that down , too . ( Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them . ) <h> Is ' Covid toe ' a symptom of the disease ? <p> There is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains , which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes . The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus . Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions , but they are usually common in the coldest winter months . Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms , but some dermatologists are pushing for a change , saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing . <h> Should I wear a mask ? <p> The C.D.C. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in public . This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms . Until now , the C.D.C. , like the W.H.O. , has advised that ordinary people do n't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing . Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply . Masks do n't replace hand washing and social distancing . <h> What should I do if I feel sick ? <p> If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have , and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing , call a doctor . They should give you advice on whether you should be tested , how to get tested , and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others . <h> How can I help ? <p> Charity Navigator , which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system , has a running list of nonprofits working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood through the American Red Cross , and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities . <p> " I feel like I had such a strong plan , " she said . " I knew what I was going to do -- I had been working for it all of college . Now I do n't know what I 'm going to do . " <p> For millions of college students , internships can be a steppingstone to full-time work , a vital source of income and even a graduation requirement . <p> But like so much else , summer internships have been upended by the pandemic , with a wide range of major companies , including tech firms like Yelp and entertainment behemoths like the Walt Disney Company , canceling programs and rescinding offers . Instead , students who had hoped to experience an office setting for the first time are instead looking for work at fast-food restaurants . <h> A vaccine developed in China appears to be safe and may offer protection against the virus , scientists say . <p> The early-stage trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at several laboratories and included 108 participants . Subjects who got the vaccine mounted a moderate immune response to the virus , which peaked 28 days after the inoculation , the researchers found . <p> A vaccine to the new coronavirus is considered to be the best long-term solution to ending the pandemic and helping countries reopen their societies . Nearly 100 teams worldwide are racing to test various candidates . <p> On Monday , Moderna announced that its RNA vaccine appears to be safe and effective , based on results from eight people in its trial . On Wednesday , researchers in Boston said a prototype vaccine protected monkeys from coronavirus infection . <p> The vaccine reported today was created with another virus , an adenovirus called Ad5 that easily enters human cells . <p> But the virus is one that many people already have been exposed to , and some experts have worried that too many already have antibodies to Ad5 , limiting its usefulness as a way to deliver a vaccine . <p> Although the vaccine did elicit some immune response , the results are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear how long-lasting the protection might be . <p> Apart from pain at the injection site , close to half of the participants also reported fever , fatigue and headaches , and about one in five had muscle pain . <p> The participants knew whether they were receiving a low , medium or high dose , however , which may have influenced their perceptions of the side effects . <h> Deadly diseases could surge after disruptions to vaccination programs . <p> Image <p> A health worker administered polio vaccines to children on a three-day vaccination campaign in Peshawar , Pakistan , in February.Credit ...

Diagnostic tests , for example , only detect infections during a certain period . And antibody tests alone should not be used to make decisions about when people can return to work , the Association of Public Health Laboratories and Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists warned . <p> Some public health officials also said that broad-based testing might have unintended consequences . <p> " We do n't want people to get a false sense of security , " said Karen Landers , a district medical officer with the Alabama Department of Public Health , which is not recommending that employers test all workers . <h> The virus still does not spread easily on surfaces , the C.D.C. says . <p> The virus does not spread easily via contaminated surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about wiping down grocery bags or disinfecting mailed packages , the news headlines highlighting this guidance in recent days might have brought some relief . <p> But this information is not new ; the agency has been using similar language for months .

The virus is thought to spread mainly from one person to another , typically through droplets when an infected person sneezes , coughs or talks at close range -- even if that person is not showing symptoms . <p> The C.D.C.

@@71754041 <h> ' Fear of the unknown ' : U.S. pregnant women worried by lack of virus research <p> After the first two cases of the novel coronavirus in the state of Georgia were confirmed this week , Leigh Creel , who is 20 weeks pregnant and lives outside Atlanta , made a nervous phone call to her doctor to ask about the risk to her and her fetus . <p> The response she got was not comforting . Health experts do not know if pregnant women are more susceptible to the virus or if contracting it will increase the likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes , such as pre-term labor or transmission of the virus in utero . They are racing to learn more about the sometimes fatal respiratory disease that has rapidly spread worldwide from China , including how it might uniquely affect pregnant women . <p> For expectant mothers , the mystery surrounding the virus is worrying .

Sienas said her hospital has stopped short of urging pregnant women to quarantine themselves , contrary to local public health official guidelines . <p> Instead , she has emphasized diligent hygiene and avoiding close contact with others , the same guidance the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has offered on its website . To that end , Sienas has tried to arrange check-ups via telephone , aiming to limit the number of in-person visits pregnant patients make to the hospital . <p> " There 's definitely that fear of the unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that you do n't know and ca n't control , " Sienas told Reuters .

" ' WE DO N'T REALLY KNOW ' <p> Scientists have not yet developed a vaccine against the virus , and research on its transmission and effects on pregnant women has been limited . A narrow study of nine coronavirus-positive pregnant women in the Wuhan region of China , all in their third trimester , found no evidence that COVID-19 was transferred in utero . The women showed symptoms similar to non-pregnant adult patients . <p> The World Health Organization published an analysis of 147 pregnant women ( 64 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 , 82 who were suspected and 1 who was asymptomatic ) and found that 8% had a severe condition and 1% were critically ill .

Sign up here . <p> South Korea offered global policy makers an alternative approach for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak by refraining from a knee-jerk interest rate cut to help a struggling economy at the heart of the global tech supply chain . <p> Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the appropriate response at this stage was targeted support for the companies most affected by the biggest virus outbreak outside China , not a wider-reaching rate reduction . That 's even after downgrading growth forecasts for the year and acknowledging that the epidemic could push the economy into reverse this quarter . <p> A majority of economists polled by Bloomberg had expected the bank to respond by lowering the rate to a fresh record low , repeating a similar move taken by the bank following a virus outbreak in 2015 . <p> The BOK 's measured response comes after the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global growth if the virus epidemic continues to escalate . While some Asian banks have already opted to cut rates , there 's still little consensus on the best way to respond even after a meeting of G-20 finance and monetary chiefs at the weekend . <p> " A health security crisis is the cause of the current economic difficulties , " Lee said . " In a situation like that , micro support for self-employed businesses and companies in trouble is more effective than an interest-rate cut . " <p> Specifically , the BOK announced an increase in the cap for cheap loans available to companies affected by an accelerating virus outbreak in Korea that has now topped 1,500 cases and left pockets of the country locked down . The BOK 's lending facility is one of the policy tools it uses to manage funding conditions , and it has raised the ceiling during previous economic downturns . <p> A somewhat similar response was taken by the People 's Bank of China earlier this month when it provided medium-term funding to commercial lenders and cut the interest rate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere . Can We Say the P-Word ? <p> The bank now sees the economy growing 2.1% this year , down from a 2.3% projection in November , reflecting uncertainty over the impact of the virus . <p> Both exports and imports to China fell in the first 20 days of February despite the benefit of more work days , signaling that the virus is disrupting supply chains between South Korea and its biggest trading partner . <p> Little Room <p> While Lee still kept the door open to a possible rate cut in response to the virus , his decision illustrates the BOK 's reluctance of use remaining policy space in a blanket response when the costs of record low interest rates are stacking up . <p> " Cutting rates to zero and printing electronic money in a classic monetary response to a global slowdown will be ineffective this time around , as coronavirus infects the cogs that make up supply chains and consumer consumption , " Jeffrey Halley , senior market analyst for Oanda Asia Pacific Pte. , wrote after the decision . " If you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are done . " <p> Governor Lee said high household debt , and the difficulty to stabilize housing prices were among the factors behind the stand pat decision , and said the board assumed the coronavirus spread would peak in March . Economists who projected a rate hold pointed to concerns about an overheated property market and high household debt , alongside a weakening currency . <p> " The BOK may cut rates after the government rolls out an extra budget in March , creating the impression that the two are working closely , " Meritz Securities Co. economist Stephen Lee said . " For now , providing support for small businesses while keeping the rate on hold is the optimal choice for the BOK . " <p> What Bloomberg 's Economist Says <p> " With consumers staying home and shops closed due to virus outbreak , broad-based monetary easing may have diminished effectiveness .

" It is pretty bulletproof -- whatever associated disease we remove , the association is still there , " Melzer tells The Guardian . " So it looks as if it is the gene variant that is doing it . " <p> It is still possible that dementia itself is playing a roll , says David Curtis , an honorary professor at the University College London Genetics Institute , to The Guardian .

Due to this , its inventory in March doubled from the level of 10-14 days of stock that the company usually holds . The Bengaluru-headquartered firm 's CEO Sanjay Sharma tells Samreen Ahmad that despite the coronavirus crisis , MTR Foods is still hopeful of reaching the Rs 1,000-crore revenue milestone by the end of this year . The FMCG major will also focus significantly on leveraging e-commerce channels , going forward . Edited excerpts ... <p> How is MTR Foods running the show when most of the other branded packaged food products are not to be found in the market ? <p> We started acting early in the crisis as the company is held by Norwegian conglomerate Orkla and Covid-19 crisis had already hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-planning was already communicated to us by our European counterparts . So we had started working on a plan by March 10 . We started building up stocks . As compared to the average stock level of 10-14 days that we hold , we decided to hold an inventory for up to 30 days . The manufacturing cycle had already started working towards that . Currently , it has depleted to 10 days as demands has increased . <p> What are the major supply-chain challenges that MTR has experienced during the lockdown ? <p> We have faced a business-continuity issue . The first week of lockdown was all about trying to reset the entire system . Our suppliers who were giving us raw materials were not seen as food processing units . So , we had to request the government to recognise them as critical services . We had to restructure our entire plants and methods of working , such as slowing down our lines and ensuring that all sanitation and social distancing norms were being followed . Many workers had gone home because of Ugadi , a major festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back after arranging buses . We have paid 20-30 per cent more to secure trucks to transport our products . <p> What is the current capacity utilisation of MTR factories ? How are you looking to scale up ? <p> Currently our factories are working at 60 per cent capacity , with just 50 per cent of our workforce . We have a unit in Pune that is in the Red zone so for the past four weeks . It has been open only for two days . We have seven contract manufacturers in places like Indore and Guntur , which too are red zones so there have been major challenges to get these working . There 's an on-and-off impact whenever a new Covid-19 case is detected in areas near our warehouses or factories , which has disrupted the supply chain . <p> How is the company taking care of the health of its employees ? <p> To a large extent , the factories have been quarantined . No outside person can enter the factories , including suppliers . We are following strong sanitisation measures and have arranged transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are sanitised after every trip . The buses are 50 per cent occupied to avoid any contact . We keep a track of who has travelled in each bus and temperature checks are done . We are working in shifts and those in shift-one are not allowed to interact with those in the second shift . Also plants are sanitised after every shift . <p> On an average we do around 8-10 launches in a year . Even in the current year we have done two launches ( hyperlocal spices ) before the crisis hit us . Given the current situation , we have kept our innovations on hold at this point of time as we want to see what will be the new normal situation . The consumer life has significantly changed and needs such as convenience are being evoked as the workload in homes have increased . We have seen a lot of demand in basic spices and breakfast mixes . Interestingly , as sweets shops are shut , we are seeing a huge demand for gulab jamun mixes . <p> Will MTR Foods be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current crisis ? <p> We are currently over Rs 900 crore in terms of revenue and it would be possible to touch the Rs 1,000-crore milestone this year . If the situation stabilises fast and we are able to find an equilibrium between managing this crisis and managing the business supply chain , then I see no reason why we will not hit those numbers . <p> This is one of those events that will change the world substantially . E-commerce is going to come out in a significant way and it is going to be one of our top priorities that we will carry into the future . Our e-commerce sales almost doubled to four per cent in April as compared to last year as we tied up with companies such as Swiggy and Zomato to get our products delivered . Also , as eating out will reduce and consumption patterns will change , we will also have to align our business accordingly .

Members of the public are urged to follow the advice of established institutions like WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and to beware of claims suggesting ways to prevent the virus . <p> Here are some of the claims spreading online , and the facts you need to know about them . <p> <p> CLAIM : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people shave off facial hair to protect against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC published an infographic recommending that men shave their beards to protect against the coronavirus circulated widely as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased to 60 in the U.S. The CDC did not release this graphic in relation to preventing the new coronavirus , nor did the agency recommend that people shave off their facial hair to protect against it . The graphic dates to 2017 and depicts the types of facial hair that do and do not work well when wearing filtering facepiece respirators . Tom Skinner , a spokesman for the CDC , told the AP in an email that the graphic " was developed several years ago and is intended for professionals who wear respirators for worker protection . CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings ( in the community ) . " In the midst of the new coronavirus outbreak , many people began wearing masks to cover their nose and mouth . In most cases , they are surgical masks , as opposed to more advanced respiratory masks . Surgical masks are loose-fitting , compared to tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect people from inhaling smaller airborne particles , unlike respirators which filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles . The CDC also notes that when it comes to the new coronavirus people should only wear a face mask if they 're experiencing symptoms or are being investigated for possibly having the virus . <p> <p> CLAIM : Everyone should ensure that their mouth and throat is moist and never dry . Take sips of water every 15 minutes because even if the virus gets into your mouth by drinking water or liquids , it will wash the virus down through your esophagus and into your stomach where your stomach acid will kill the virus . <p> THE FACTS : Drinking water prevents dehydration but will not prevent anyone from catching the new coronavirus . Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious-diseases expert at Vanderbilt University , said the claims are incorrect . While medical professionals typically recommend keeping up fluid intake , Schaffner said drinking more water will not keep anyone from catching the virus . We always caution anyone healthy and people who are sick to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It makes you feel better ; there is no clear indication that it directly protects you against complications . " <p> <p> CLAIM : Garlic can help cure the new coronavirus . <p> THE FACTS : There is no evidence that garlic cures the virus . While garlic does have antimicrobial properties , WHO said that there is no evidence that eating garlic will help with the virus . <p> <p> CLAIM : Chlorine dioxide will help get rid of the new virus from China . <p> AP 'S ASSESSMENT : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against ingesting the bleaching agent . As news spread about the outbreak , social media accounts began promoting the idea that drinking chlorine dioxide or related products with names like Miracle Mineral Solution would help wipe out the virus . The FDA told The Associated Press in a statement that they do not recommend ingesting this product . " We understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of this illness , " the agency said . The FDA warns that drinking the product can cause nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and symptoms of severe dehydration . <p> <p> CLAIM : Surgical masks protect against the new coronavirus . <p> THE FACTS : Medical masks alone can not protect against being infected with the new coronavirus . WHO advised that the masks should be worn by those showing symptoms of coughing and difficulty breathing , so they do n't spread disease to others . There is no evidence that masks protect people who are not sick . <p> <p> CLAIM : The new coronavirus can cause 50 percent fibrosis of the lungs . <p> THE FACTS : False . Experts say there is no evidence that the new virus causes fibrosis . Dr. Robert Legare Atmar , an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine , said patients have not been shown to have fibrosis , which occurs when lung tissue begins scarring . The virus has been known in more serious cases to cause pneumonia , severe respiratory syndrome or kidney failure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see symptoms in as little two to 14 days , according to the Centers for Disease Control . Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious-diseases expert at Vanderbilt University , said he has not seen studies indicating that after patients recover from the new coronavirus , they suffer serious lung damage . " The vast majority of people get better , " he said . <p> <p> CLAIM : Colloidal silver products can help prevent or protect against the new coronavirus from China . <p> THE FACTS : The silver solution has no known benefits in the body when it is ingested , according to officials with the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health , a federal scientific research agency . Colloidal silver is made up of silver particles suspended in a liquid . The liquid solution is often pushed as a miracle solution to boost the immune system and cure diseases . Experts have long said the solution has no known health benefits and can cause serious side effects . The FDA has taken action against companies promoting colloidal silver products with misleading claims . <p> <p> CLAIM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak happened . <p> THE FACTS : While Lysol products have labels that state they disinfect against " Human coronavirus , " it is not a specific reference to the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December . The current virus is part of a large family of viruses that can range from the common cold to SARS , a viral respiratory illness that spread to two dozen countries in 2003 before being contained . According to Lysol 's website , specific Lysol products have demonstrated that they are effective against viruses similar to 2019-nCoV on hard , non-porous surfaces . <p> <p> CLAIM : Symptoms of new coronavirus include vomiting blood . <p> THE FACTS : In late January , a video circulated on Facebook with a caption saying that a man on a train in China began vomiting blood after being infected with the new coronavirus .

@@71831441 <p> Like many Australians , I write this article sitting in my home office in Wollongong as part of the new stay-at-home directive . I have spent much of the morning , possibly like most other Australians , reading and watching the latest daily news on COVID-19 and trying to assess what it means for our collective health and national economy . <p> My regular morning conversations with Peter Strong ( CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia ) , and the now daily conversations with fellow COSBOA board members , reveal that business closures and employment destruction is occurring at a dramatic rate . <p> Even more sobering is the fact the small business sector comprises more than 2 million businesses -- sole traders , small businesses and family businesses -- employing around 5 millon other Australians in total . But this is n't just about small businesses ; big business is being hit too . Just look at Qantas , Virgin , Myer and other large retailers . <p> It appears to me and my board , however , that something is missing from the national dialogue : national belief . <p> The challenge we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities . The first is to keep our people safe from physical and emotional harm , and to ensure all those brave Australians on the COVID-19 frontline -- the doctors and nurses and many others -- are fully supported . For many of us , that means staying at home . <p> The second challenge is to minimise the impact on the economic wellbeing of all Australians . This means keeping as many businesses and workplaces open as can safely be done . ' National lockdown ' and ' national shutdown ' are unfortunate terms as they do n't reflect what needs to be done . <p> We need to close workplaces that represent a clear and present danger to the spread of COVID-19 . We need people to severely limit their travel and contacts . Nothing more , nothing less . <p> It is disappointing that for many the COVID-19 response is being promoted as a contest between these two objectives . For the good of our country , it can not be . We must respond to both simultaneously . <p> Australia is up to this task ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationing after the war , people found inventive ways of using barbed wire , for example , and nylon stockings were often used as an alternative to broken fan belts on cars . More recently , our country has gifted the world seat belts and airbags in cars , wireless fidelity ( Wi-Fi ) , and phenomenal health innovations in areas like hearing devices , cataract surgery and heart transplants . <p> Australians are resourceful . When we get knocked down , we get back up again . We find solutions in the face of incredible adversity -- just ask all those people affected by fires , floods , storms and cyclones during our lifetime . <p> So why is this crisis any different ? <p> Some might say COSBOA is full of hopeless optimists or that we are coming from a position of ' blind hope ' . But it 's not so . <p> Our economy is strong and has underlying advantages that will help us cope with this unprecedented crisis . We produce almost all our own food ( unlike some countries in Europe and Asia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having previously relied on heavy manufacturing , we have since replaced it with advanced manufacturing in areas like defence , telecommunications , food , pharmaceuticals and IT . <p> This means much of our economy is well placed to get through this latest crisis . Even service-based industries like hospitality , will recover quickly . We are a sociable lot and as soon as it is safe to do so , we will undoubtedly head to pubs , clubs , restaurants and cafes in droves . <p> It might mean we do n't travel as much internationally in the immediate future , but is that really such a bad thing ? This crisis will give us the chance to help tourism businesses as we re-engage with the natural beauty and vast open space that is the continent of Australia . <p> The key to our survival is to do exactly what the National Cabinet is doing right now . That is , keep money circulating to all Australian households and allow businesses to hit the ' pause ' button . This means that , when it is safe to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money needed to kick start our economy -- although for many , this will be lower than normal in the short term . <p> The rate of our national recovery will depend on two things : a strong economy and a strong financial system . Fortunately , we have both . <p> Successive federal governments have steered us through the global financial crisis ( and before that , the Asian financial crisis ) and put us on the cusp of a national budget surplus before this crisis hit . Our world record of 29 years of successive economic growth means we will emerge in a much stronger position compared with many other world economies . <p> While we have criticised the banks in recent years , Peter Strong and all my fellow board members have been privileged to see how the strength of our banking system is now being harnessed for the good of every Australian . Together with their peers , Australian Banking Association chair Matt Comyn and CEO Anna Bligh have put the banking system at the full disposal of the national economy . <p> There are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in the background . Sure , some like the biggest landlords are being dragged to the table , but at least they are coming to the table . <p> And traditional differences are being set aside ; COSBOA has been working with the leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in recent days to better understand their proposal for wage subsidies to help all Australian 's through the crisis . Together , with a collaboration of other peak business bodies , we have united to call for more meaningful assistance to flow to displaced employees . <p> If employer groups and unions can work together to address these challenges , then anything is possible . <p> And so , we come back to the point of what is missing : belief . Granted , it is hard to believe in the face of uncertainty , but we are well placed to survive the economic hit over time . COVID-19 is bigger than anything we have faced , barring the great wars , but as people ( or society ) we possess the resourcefulness to overcome it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blind hope ' . Nor is it ' unrealistically optimistic ' . All the things we need to get through this are already in place . The next few months will be testing times with mourning and grief to be experienced , but I believe our own resilience , and our leaders ' fortitude , will see us through that . We must be confident that , after the worst of it , we will rebound faster than other economies . <p> We are all in this together . Criticising each other is a waste of time and energy . We must first believe that we can recover and protect our most vulnerable . And then each of us must work cooperatively to make it happen . <p> The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses . So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ?

@@71828441 <p> When markets correct , it 's always for a different reason , but its almost always follows a market high when optimism is pervasive . Anton Tagliaferro , founder and Investment Director of Investors Mutual , said in a recent webinar that while you ca n't predict the timing of a correction , preparation is key . He has four simple rules for situations like this : <p> Always understand the companies you own and why you own them . Do you have an idea where they might be in three years ' time ? <p> Keep your leverage low . Swings can be violent , and leverage just amplifies them <p> Try to stay calm and understand what 's happening . Do n't panic-sell . <p> Look for potential opportunities in good quality companies . <p> While he acknowledges that " there is some value appearing " in markets now , he warns that this crisis is complex , even for someone with 30 years of experience in markets . <h> Three simultaneous crises <p> While most investors are viewing this as a single crisis , Anton says there are actually three major crises occurring right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lockdowns . He believes this will fade over the coming three to six months . <p> The financial crisis . Corporate bonds are selling off , inter-bank markets are freezing , it 's " not dissimilar to what we saw on the GFC , " says Anton . <p> The economic crisis . While the short term will be severe , the longer-term outcomes depend on government action . <p> For some companies , the impact is obvious - airlines , travel companies , hotels , casinos . Others are either unaffected , or even positively affected , such as supermarkets . The third group is those that are being affected in strange and unexpected ways . <p> One such company is pathology company , Sonic Healthcare . It had been doing well until the end of February . Even in early March is was trading well as they won COVID-19 testing contacts from governments . But then people stopped going to their GPs and getting routine testing , which has had a large impact on their business . <p> He also warns of flow-on effects if the recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unemployed or has discretionary income cut , it could have a big impact on consumer businesses . <p> He says the expectation of a sharp , quick recovery is " probably unrealistic . " <h> How IML are responding <p> Anton says to look beyond the headlines , and even suggests turning off the news altogether . If nothing else , it 'll probably do wonders for anxiety levels . <p> On a more practical front , IML are doing a " company by company review . " They 're looking at various scenarios to see how things might play out . <p> " Obviously most share prices have corrected , 30 , 40 , 50 percent , sometimes more . You have to say to yourself , ' Well , is that factoring in now , a worst case ? Will the company survive ? ' If yes , it will , what would it look like if the world is not such a jolly place in six months ' time ? " <p> They 're looking for long duration assets -- companies with a licence , service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course they need to have strong balance sheets . <p> " The perception of what is deemed acceptable gearing and is not , will change quite significantly in the months ahead . Some companies were tempted to take on more debt , and extend their debt , because of cheap interest rates . Many boards will probably think twice about that level of gearing going forward . " <p> While many companies had a good first eight months of the financial year , the last four months will likely wipe that out altogether . He says you have to look past 2020 into 2021 and consider if it 's a company you want to own then . <h> Sector views <p> Anton has talked consistently about the high valuations in the technology sector with companies like Wisetech and Afterpay . Despite the large falls that some of these companies have experienced already , he said he thinks " there 's probably more to go in some of those . " <p> Previously , IML had positioned the portfolio in what they saw as resilient sectors , such as utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of their businesses , utilities have held up ok . While their healthcare names such as Sonic Healthcare and Integrated Diagnostics had been doing well , in recent weeks they 've begun to suffer as people cancel or avoid pathology tests . <p> While they believed the gaming sector would be resilient when they invested , nobody could have predicted the impact of the lockdown . With most casinos and hotels closed , and most sports cancelled , this is far from a typical downturn . <h> Looking directly at the companies <p> Despite the hit to the share price , IML continues to hold Crown . It 's the leading operator in Australia , and due to the sale of their Macau assets a couple of years ago they 've got a low level of net debt on the balance sheet . They 've already sold $650 million out of $800 million worth of luxury apartments and received a 20% deposit on those sales .

The licenses on these three locations expire in 2050 , 2113 , and 2060 respectively . <p> Orica is a company that he says they 've been " adding to gently . " It 's the world 's largest explosives manufacturer and holds long-term contracts with all the big miners . Many of those contracts have set pricing too , even if volumes may reduce . They also earn a lot of their income overseas , which should benefit Australian investors given the falling Aussie Dollar . He reckons at current prices , Orica looks like " fairly good value . " <p> Another company that could come out of this crisis looking healthy is Sonic Healthcare . It benefits from the long-term tailwind of the ageing population , and it may benefit from ongoing testing for COVID-19 , which he says will probably become a standard test for anyone entering the country . Sonic 's competitors are also highly geared , sometimes with debt eight- or nine-times equity .

He said it was too expensive previously , but after falling from over $30 to under $20 , they 've started to look at it more closely . The company has been impacted by the closure of casinos and hotels on a couple of fronts . Firstly , casinos are unlikely to be buying new machines while they 're closed . But additionally , Aristocrat is missing out on the annuity-like revenue they normally make by taking a share of machine takings . On the plus side though , their two major competitors in the US are massively indebted and could face challenges in this environment . This could allow them to take market share , talent , or make cheap acquisitions . He says they 're not buying at current prices , but they " have a price target in mind .

@@71902541 <p> After months in 2019 of record-breaking wildfires , heatwaves and slow-moving tropical megastorms , 2020 might have been a year when the international community was ready to make serious strides in the fight against the earth 's rising temperatures . Instead , we are facing a virulent coronavirus pandemic that has shut down most economic activity worldwide and sidelined the issue of climate change . <p> As we struggle to find our path back from COVID-19 , companies and governments should not overlook the lessons the virus is teaching us about the need to get ahead of crises . The strategies being implemented today to offset the economic impact of months of lockdowns might also inform efforts to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions moving forward . As companies make calls about how , where and when to cut costs and where to invest post-COVID-19 , they need to start using a green lens to make sure that decisions on such items as capital investment or asset retirement also reflect their future needs to reduce their carbon footprint . <p> An analysis by Oliver Wyman and CDP , a leading climate data provider , showed that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net reduction in operational costs of ? 41 billion for European companies . At this point , savings are something corporate executives everywhere desperately need to find , given projections of the many months -- potentially years -- it will take for the economy to bounce back after the virus subsides . <p> For many businesses , the lockdowns are providing a kind of real-world experiment on how to survive months of little-to-no business activity . Radical changes in the way many businesses operate and serve their clients -- necessitated by social distancing -- are already significantly , if inadvertently , cutting CO2 emissions . In China , the world 's biggest emitter , the lockdown from mid-January through March is estimated to have reduced emissions by as much as 25% in the first quarter . While these gains are no doubt temporary , some of the operational changes that accompanied the drop could provide insights on how to optimise business ' carbon footprints from important emissions sources like office space , travel and product distribution . <h> Supply chain lessons <p> Supply chains have been substantially rethought after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest contributors to a company 's carbon footprint , the supply chain is typically a corporation 's Achilles heel when it comes to efforts to reduce emissions . One of the biggest obstacles is that companies often do n't have sufficient visibility into supplier operations to get a full appreciation of their carbon footprints . <p> The response of some companies to the current disruption has been to add domestic suppliers to their mix or to give those they already use a bigger share of their business . In some cases , companies have experimented with nearby 3-D printing to replace certain components in shortage because of lockdowns . Either solution would reduce transport-related emissions , which suggests the approach should be retained after COVID-19 subsides . <p> Some businesses are also choosing to limit the number of suppliers with which they do business . This way they can work more closely with them , even helping to bolster their operations through investment or guaranteed business . Again , this can be a plus because it gives a company leverage to insist on stricter measures to reduce emissions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewable energy to make the cut . <p> Coronavirus could trigger biggest fall in carbon emissions since World War II <p> Image : Reuters/Global Carbon Project <h> Stimulus opportunities <p> For companies that believe businesses should be moving aggressively to lower emissions , there 's a lot at stake . One of the most obvious sources of risk and opportunity on the horizon is the raft of governmental economic stimulus measures being enacted . Stimulus packages that tolerate higher emissions as a necessary evil could increase the relative costs of decarbonisation , placing companies that pursue it at a competitive disadvantage and making nations more vulnerable to climate crises down the road . <p> If governments want to ensure a move toward lower emissions , they should attach some conditions on stimulus money that encourage companies to incorporate environmental risk management into their strategies for recovery . For instance , stimulus measures could be more generous for companies with low-carbon business models and those that channel investment into green infrastructure . This could prove transformational for developing capital-intensive technologies like hydrogen energy or carbon capture and storage . Businesses working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engage with policy-makers to ensure that economic packages support decarbonisation plans rather than undermine them . <p> Right now , the shape of the coming global recession and subsequent recovery remains uncertain . Based on expert projections , it seems likely the world will be grappling with waves of viral outbreaks and some form of travel and social restrictions for many more months -- perhaps even through 2022 , if recent research from Harvard University proves correct . <p> Many things may also be different once societies and economies emerge from this crisis . Customer preferences and behaviours may have changed . Policies and regulations may have been recast . Concern about global threats , such as climate change , may have been heightened or set aside entirely . <h> Our next COVID ? <p> Undertaking scenario analysis associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy in the midst of the current crisis may seem like an indulgence , but it allows businesses to reassess the risks and opportunities and adapt plans accordingly . While dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact is rightly the priority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade hence if we do n't begin to take the need to begin the energy transition more seriously . <p> While the pandemic will end eventually , the effect of rising greenhouse gas emissions will continue to wreak havoc on Earth 's climate until businesses commit to lower emissions .

" China has a history in the past , of course , of clamming up when it wants to . " <p> Dr. Mackenzie questioned why Chinese authorities appeared to delay reporting an increase in infections in the first half of January .

Much of the scepticism came largely as the Budget was more of intent and lacked sufficient concrete measures to enthuse local demand , even as the emerging uncertainty from the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been factored in . <p> " To get the Indian economy out of the ongoing slump , bolder decisions were required and that 's where this Budget failed to deliver , " brokerage Bernstein ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget for 2020-21 " directionless " . <p> Most brokerage houses believe the government 's allocation for subsidies and spending on social and rural schemes -- just 7% higher from last year -- is lower than that needed to pump-prime the economy . <p> The cut in allocation to the government 's flagship job guarantee scheme and the expected sharp slump in capital expenditure growth to 2% next financial year from an estimated 16% in the current one are worries , said brokerage Ambit Capital . <p> The brokerage 's report titled ' How long can hope be a strategy ' pithily summarised that changes in the Budget were cosmetic in nature and " will have minimal effect " on economic growth next year . <p> Analysts also expressed concerned over the ability of the government to bridge the revenue-expenditure gap next year , with some stating that the expected 2.1 trln rupees from disinvestment in state-owned companies was a tall ask . <p> The extent of hand-wringing over prospects of economic growth can be gauged from the post-Budget note by Kotak Institutional Equities that said " No hope without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on concrete action , the market is expected to look for succour in smaller events such as gains that could accrue from the abolition of dividend distribution tax . <p> Bernstein India reiterated that the benchmark Nifty 50 index would give returns of only 5% in 2020 and that the Budget was broadly neutral for every sector . <p> Was the market expecting too much , asked BofA Securities rhetorically , stating that the finance minister had restricted fiscal deficit in line with expectation , but noting that the recent excitement in mid-cap stocks could peter out . <p> " The markets ' disappointment with the Budget will last a short while ... " and then India would trace the pace of emerging markets , the brokerage firm said . <p> Not all were sceptical , rather completely sceptical . <p> " The assumptions for this Budget seem far more realistic versus the last July document , " Dolat Capital said in a report , but not before expressing doubt over the impact of the muted growth in key expense items such as the employment guarantee scheme , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget is " neutral to negative overall " , Dolat Capital said . Neutral because it did not do anything to revise growth and earnings estimates , and negative because the expected tax breaks and push for growth did not come as forceful as expected , it said . <p> Analysts were disappointed with the overall spending and measures announced for the infrastructure sector too , with the capital expenditure on roads , railways and defence being lower than anticipated . <p> The cut in personal tax rates but without several exemptions for individuals also worried analysts , as it could lead to a fall in inflows into equity schemes of mutual funds and insurance companies . <p> With banks exercising caution in lending to corporates and small-sized companies such as real estate developers still facing a cash crunch , any fall in earnings growth of insurance and asset management companies would mean that the financial services sector may not fare as well as anticipated . <p> The other sectors that were supposed to drive growth in earnings next year , such as metals and oil and gas , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few weeks and transforms into a global epidemic , brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report . <p> Given the weakening outlook for corporate earnings , several analysts believe the valuation gap between large and small companies may sustain as investors may continue to favour safe and fundamentally strong stocks .

" <p> Professor Feng is also the safekeeper of a 2011 letter written by Yang which explains why he decided to become a democracy advocate . <p> " Through my articles , there are thousands or even hundreds of thousands of young people in China who are awakened ... they let me see there is hope for China , " Yang wrote . <h> Deadline for release or prosecution <p> Yang is only one of several citizens of western nations to be detained by China since the daughter of one of the country 's most prominent businessmen , Huawei chairman Ren Zhengfei , was detained in Canada in December 2018 . <p> The ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's embassy in Australia but did not get a response . <p> " Once you get into this world , it 's murky -- nothing is clear cut and the truth is almost impossible to know with certainty , " said Professor Hamilton . <p> " But the fact that the Chinese authorities have nabbed Mr Yang and kept him in prison at times under extremely difficult conditions -- they 've interrogated him with extreme prejudice -- it means they 're angry with him , they want something . <p> In 1997 , soon after the handover , Yang was transferred to Washington DC and took a job as a senior fellow with US think tank , the Atlantic Council . <p> There , his assignment was to gather intelligence from US think tanks and members of Congress , according to Professor Feng . <p> A spokesman for The Atlantic Council said the organisation could not locate any records indicating Mr Yang was an employee , adding the majority of their " senior fellows " have been non-resident , and unpaid . <p> " This was 20 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here even close to that time , " said Alex Kisling , deputy director for media relations of the organisation . <h> ' Fatal Weakness ' <p> Washington was his last assignment with the MSS and the former diplomat , Chen , does n't believe that Yang remained a spy after that . <p> " He wandered around the world and did n't necessarily find much important information to report back to China . " <p> In 2000 , he moved himself and his family to Australia , where according to friends he severed ties with the Chinese state . <p> His wife , Yuan Xiaoliang , spoke the ABC from her Beijing apartment , where she remains under watch by the Chinese Government . <p> She said her husband 's experience with democracy in Hong Kong and a desire to become a writer made him decide to leave the Chinese Government . <p> " He said that he had a dream and he wanted to be a writer . So , he quit his work and started writing , " she said . <p> The ABC asked Yuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she declined to answer . <p> Yuan is also the subject of an ongoing investigation relating to her husband and speaking about such sensitive matters could antagonise Beijing . <p> Traditionally , CCP prevents the families of intelligence officials from leaving China to ensure they do not betray the government . <p> It is unclear why , in this case , Beijing decided to let an employee of MSS go . <p> Chen Yonglin said it was not unusual for lower-ranking MSS officials to be able to leave China with their families after a cooling off period subsequent to their last operation . <p> " After they have spent a period of time out of the organisation , lower-ranked officials are allowed to leave with their families , " Chen said . <p> Professor Feng told the ABC he believes Yang was able to leave because he made a deal with Beijing . <p> " He must have quite a solid agreement for Chinese intelligence to give him up , " Professor Feng said . <p> " I do n't know the detail about that part of Yang 's story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligence organisation , it 's always hard to leave it . There must have been some sort of agreement .

@@71752441 <h> How the coronavirus is testing social media 's efforts to stem the flow of fake news amid global public health crisis <p> The novel coronavirus outbreak , which has now spread to 70 countries and infected more than 93,000 people , has also sparked what the World Health Organisation calls an " infodemic " . <p> The internet , including the one behind China 's Great Firewall , has been flooded with false information , most of it related to unverified cures and unproven conspiracy theories , according to AFP Fact Check , which has posted 90 fact-checks since late January when the virus became a serious health crisis in China . <p> The false information includes advice that vitamin D will prevent the virus , boiled garlic water is a cure , or that the deadly virus was created in Canada and stolen by Chinese spies . <p> Fake news is seen as more novel than factual events , which is why people were more likely to share such misinformation , according to a 2018 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . " Whereas false stories inspired fear , disgust , and surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy , and trust , " it said . <p> Last month the WHO hosted a meeting in Silicon Valley with American internet giants , including Facebook and Twitter , to discuss ways to crack down on misinformation about the epidemic . <p> WHO is posting information on its official social media accounts , which on Friday were expanded to include the short video platform TikTok , owned by Beijing-based ByteDance and popular with teenagers . <p> " With social media , we 're in a completely different world . It 's not just journalists , it 's not tabloids -- anyone can spread rumours , " said Michel Hockx , a professor of Chinese Literature and Culture at the University of Notre Dame . <p> Misinformation has become an acute issue for western social media since the 2016 US election , with Facebook in particular coming under fire in recent years over its role in communicating fake news and polarising politics . The expanding public health crisis , which has killed almost 3,200 , mostly in China , has provided an opportunity to gauge how effective efforts have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Amid the epidemic , Facebook has taken measures to remove content with false claims and conspiracy theories . It has been working with 56 fact-checking partners in 46 languages to rate fake news and alert users who read or share it if it is false . It also provides free advertising to the WHO and health authorities to enable them to run coronavirus education campaigns on social media , said a company spokeswoman . <p> In contrast , Facebook 's peers have taken a different approach to policing fake news on the virus . A Twitter representative said in an emailed response that it mainly monitors platform manipulation and ensures that credible content appears upfront when users search or look for relevant trends . <p> In a blog post last month TikTok said it is working with third-party fact checking organisations and highlights in-app notices around hashtags related to the coronavirus to remind users of its community guidelines so they do not help spread fake news . <p> In China , WHO has been working closely with internet giants such as Tencent and Weibo to counter rumours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The company representative said " everyone has a role to play in ensuring misinformation does n't spread on the internet , and we encourage people who use Twitter not to share information unless they can verify that it 's true . " <p> " I do n't think censorship will do much to stop misinformation unless all platforms do it at the same time , " said Niam Yaraghi , an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut who studies the economics of health information technologies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will move to other ones that do not censor and unfortunately users will even trust the alternative platforms more which will make the effect of misinformation worse , " Yaraghi said . <p> In China , social media platforms rely on government-backed sources to verify rumours . Starting late January , the Twitter-like platform Weibo has been sending out a daily digest of false information about the coronavirus that has been refuted by government agencies , state-backed media , the Public Security Bureau and the country 's cyber police . <p> Still , netizens have grown sceptical about the credibility of Chinese government sources since the death of doctor Li Wenliang , one of the first whistle-blowers who tried to share information about the coronavirus in the very early stages , only to be reprimanded by local police . <p> " There is n't a trustworthy authority in China to give people the right information , " Tang said , " The Chinese CDC Center for Disease Control and Prevention is the supporting group of government officials .

Rather than wearing masks to prevent the flu , Americans tend to use other methods . <p> Harvard School of Public Health polls in May 2009 showed that when the swine flu pandemic happened , 67 percent of respondents washed their hands or used hand sanitizer more frequently , 55 percent made preparations to stay at home if they or their family member were sick and 35 percent took steps to avoid being near someone with flu-like symptoms .

" So masks always felt like an accessory and not a way to manage the spread of an infection . " <p> For Covid-19 , while Hong Kong experts are stressing the necessity of masks in protection , the CDC says the opposite , writing on its website that " no recommendation can be made at this time for mask use in the community by asymptomatic persons .

I am not a killer , I am a farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not the first time ' <p> Conservation group Friends of Earth ( FOE ) posted the koala photos online in the hope it would lead to stricter regulations . <p> The organisation 's land-use researcher Anthony Amis said : " It 's disturbing because it is not the first time it has happened in the south-west " . <p> " In 2013 , similar issues were reported by the press and in 2014 , 2015 we were getting reports in from animal carers down there that similar instances were happening - this particular incident seems to be the worst of the lot , " he said . <p> One of the dead koalas at the site . <p> Friends of the Earth <p> " In south-west Victoria , in the last 20 years there were about 150-200,000 hectares of blue gum plantation planted - koalas love blue gums - so as this industry has moved into the area , koalas have moved into these plantations , then the plantations are logged after 15 years ... that 's the disaster . " <h> ' It 's a slap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incident breaches the Wildlife Act 1975 - which protects koalas from being killed , harassed or disturbed and can attract a fine of $8,000 and an additional fine of more than $800 per animal . <p> Those convicted can also face six months imprisonment and a lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia , Bruce Lindsay , told SBS News that the government could possibly investigate two other laws as well ; one being " the prevention of cruelty to animals act " . <p> " The third area of law is actually the regulation of forestry itself ; there is a code of practice which includes the management of plantations and also the protection of biodiversity at plantations , " he said . <p> But Mr Amis said the penalties do not go far enough and are the equivalent of a " slap on the wrist " , doing little to deter individuals or logging companies from repeat offending . <p> " Potentially , even if this guy goes through the court process and is found guilty , could be up to a maybe a $10-20,000 fine max , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the fines are n't there for people that do the wrong thing . " <p> An operation is underway to rescue the remaining koalas . <p> Friends of the Earth <h> ' There is a difference between logging and land clearing ' <p> Logging company South West Fibre , which worked on the property until November last year , has condemned the incident and adviser Robert Hadler said the company is in no way connected to the koalas ' deaths or injuries as the land was returned to the property owner by Christmas . <p> " We have a koala management plan which includes individual spotters to identify koalas in trees - the trees are then quarantined from harvesting and all koalas are identified , mapped and protected during the harvesting process , " he said . <p> The company harvested around 28 hectares of the 55-hectare property , leaving 12,000 trees behind , an amount Mr Hadler said left sufficient habitat for the 72 koalas they counted on the property . <p> " There is a difference between logging and land clearing . In the case of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a partial amount of trees on the property , " he said . <p> " The subsequent land clearing that appears to have been undertaken was total land clearing where all the trees and remnant vegetation on the property were cleared . " <h> ' We 've got to look long term ' <p> Mr Amis wants the government to take a long term approach to koala protection which goes beyond enforcing stricter regulations for logging companies , but considers where koalas can be relocated to if their habitats are being cleared , " You ca n't just take a koala out of its environment and put it somewhere else 50km away and expect everything is going to be fine , " he said . <p> " We call on Dan Andrews to get a koala plan happening that has the long term interests of the animal at heart .

" It 's simply not a fact that whatever they say counts . " <p> The renewed R&amp;D push will likely help Huawei cut its dependence on U.S. technology , after the Trump administration blocked its access to some key suppliers , such as Alphabet Inc.
